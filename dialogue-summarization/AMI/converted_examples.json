                "B : Right .",
                "B : Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting .",
                "B : Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .",
                "B : And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control ,",
                "B : like absolute final decision ,",
                "B : um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .",
                "B : So um",
                "B : just from from last time to recap ,",
                "B : we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back ,",
                "B : it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons ,",
                "B : maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing ,",
                "B : um hopefully a jog-dial ,",
                "B : and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .",

                "D : Um , there are a few changes we've made .",
                "D : Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,",
                "B : Okay .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : so instead we've um <disfmarker>",
                "D : this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,",
                "D : very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm",
                "D : um button .",
                "C : Mm 'kay .",
                "D : Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .",
                "A : And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ?",
                "A : the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .",
                "C : Where are they ?",
                "A : Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?",

                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .",
                "A : If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker>",
                "C : Right .",
                "C : Okay .",

                "C : Right .",
                "A : whereas many <disfmarker> the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .",
                "B : So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ?",
                "D : <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap>",

                "C : in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually ,",
                "C : so that would be <disfmarker>",

                "D : But um <vocalsound>",
                "D : this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button",
                "D : if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .",
                "A : <vocalsound> Excuse me .",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",

                "D : I'm not sure if that counts but <disfmarker>",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .",

                "A : Okay um",
                "A : and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .",

                "D : You can see we're we're all very far beyond the <disfmarker>",

                "A : So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .",

                "B : How about these ?",

                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So what that means is that um <disfmarker>",
                "B : <vocalsound> And so we've got point three to get rid of .",
                "B : Um and we ha",
                "B : where are the four <disfmarker> the four push buttons are where exactly now ?",

                "B : how can it be something in between ?",

                "A : We just report that it has to be over budget <vocalsound> ,",

                "C : Yeah",
                "C : we could just go with um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah w",
                "A : Normal coloured buttons .",
                "B : Well do you want colour differentiation here ?",

                "D : <vocalsound> So I reckon <disfmarker>",
                "B : Um <disfmarker>",
                "C : How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?",

                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : That's a freebie .",

                "A : <vocalsound>",

                "B : So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now .",
                "B : So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore ,",
                "B : and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing ,",
                "B : which I think is fair enough ,",
                "B : and so this is gonna be one big thing here .",

                "C : because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that <disfmarker>",

                "A : You you still have your blue fingers .",
                "C : so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a <disfmarker>",
                "D : <vocalsound> <vocalsound>",
                "D : Is it ?",

                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : The idea is that I've set up <disfmarker>",
                "C : I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,",
                "C : and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,",
                "C : and uh so we can review that .",
                "C : Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary",
                "C : because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but <disfmarker>",
                "C : Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?",

                "C : Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board ,",
                "C : so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um <disfmarker> sort of review where we stand with it .",
                "C : Okay , so um <disfmarker>",
                "C : So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,",
                "C : uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,",
                "C : okay .",
                "B : Mm 'kay .",
                "C : So these i these i th are the <disfmarker>",
                "C : and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,",

                "C : we just come to an agreement .",
                "B : Okay .",

                "C : Okay ,",
                "C : so we can say then that uh out of a possible <disfmarker>",
                "C : or what would be our goal here ?",
                "B : Out of forty nine , I guess .",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .",
                "C : We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .",
                "B : 'S pretty good .",
                "C : So it's pretty good .",
                "C : Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal .",
                "C : Right ?",
                "B : Uh yeah .",
                "C : I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about",

                "C : about thirty one ,",
                "B : about thirty one .",
                "C : and then invert that , it's <disfmarker>",
                "B : So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah .",
                "C : Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .",
                "B : It's pretty good .",
                "C : Okay , good .",
                "C : That was just a little formality for us to go through .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Yep , oh",
                "C : hundred pound pen . <vocalsound>",

                "C : Yeah that's that's me .",
                "C : I did have one other um one other frame I thought ,",
                "C : I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information ,",
                "C : I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .",
                "B : Uh-huh .",
                "C : It's not something I need to p push through ,",
                "C : but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant ,",
                "A : Yep .",
                "C : I dunno the <gap> <disfmarker>",

                "C : it's fine .",
                "C : I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .",

                "C : uh okay I'll just go through your system then .",
                "C : The the room uh is fairly institutional ,",

                "C : Yeah , sure .",

                "C : my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement <disfmarker>",
                "B : From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?",
                "C : Yeah from <disfmarker>",
                "C : and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .",

                "A : <vocalsound> Excuse me .",
                "C : I think it's good .",
                "C : I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation ,",
                "C : but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : you know , innovative thought with .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within .",
                "C : And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker>",

                "B : okay .",
                "C : But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .",
                "C : It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free <disfmarker>",
                "B : So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker>",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .",
                "A : I think controlling is not the right word ,",
                "A : I think the interactions are very structured .",
                "C : Yeah maybe not co confining .",
                "A : I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .",

                "B : Okay .",
                "A : I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",
                "A : but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way .",
                "B : Uh-huh .",
                "C : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Okay ,",
                "B : uh what about teamwork ?",
                "C : Um did , you wanna comment Craig ?",
                "D : Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Fully agree .",
                "A : I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate ,",
                "A : but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "A : um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go <vocalsound> .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ?",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : Not just yet .",

                "A : Okay .",
                "B : Okay , um so um to s to",
                "B : to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "A : I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .",
                "C : in it <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm-hmm ,",
                "C : mm-hmm ,",
                "A : They don't support the team working together , you know ,",
                "C : mm-hmm ,",
                "B : Oh right , okay .",
                "C : exactly .",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : I mean if you <disfmarker>",
                "A : they're still very individual tools .",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork",
                "C : because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation",
                "B : Mm .",
                "C : I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,",
                "C : but um",
                "A : We had Play-Doh fun <vocalsound> .",
                "C : yeah ,",
                "C : but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept ,",
                "C : and we sit here together and do it ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : well that's what teamwork is .",
                "C : To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : I'm not dissatisfied with it .",
                "B : Right ,",
                "B : uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ?",
                "A : No , not really .",
                "B : Okay ,",
                "B : um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ?",
                "B : Um did anybody think anything was like really useful ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : anything was pretty un f",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "B : unsupportive ?",
                "C : I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,",
                "C : but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been ,",
                "C : maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "C : Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that .",
                "C : I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype",
                "C : and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : And point at ?",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : and and",
                "C : and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,",
                "C : we're just <disfmarker>",
                "C : we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .",
                "C : It wasn't until we had this here , you know ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book .",
                "B : Ah .",
                "C : But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um <disfmarker>",
                "B : So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?",
                "C : Think could be , yeah .",
                "A : I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah , yeah .",
                "A : and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .",

                "C : Yeah , yeah .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place ,",
                "C : Yeah .",

                "B : Okay .",
                "A : you know in the centre of the <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare ,",
                "C : whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it ,",
                "B : Alright .",
                "C : um 'ca you know ,",
                "C : just 'cause that's sorta how we <disfmarker> what we were set up to to use while we had our time .",
                "B : Okay uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings <vocalsound> .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent <disfmarker> we spent a lot of time doing that .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally ,",

                "B : And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control ,",
                "B : um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .",
                "B : we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back ,",
                "B : it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons ,",
                "B : maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing ,",
                "B : um hopefully a jog-dial ,",
                "B : and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .",
                "D : Um , there are a few changes we've made .",
                "D : Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,",
                "D : this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,",
                "D : very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm",
                "D : Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .",
                "A : the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .",
                "A : Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?",
                "A : The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .",
                "A : If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker>",
                "A : It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .",
                "A : That's a number pad .",
                "B : Where are we gonna have the slogan ?",
                "D : just like right inside there .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger",
                "D : so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap>",
                "B : So we're talking about ten centimetres .",
                "D : We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .",
                "C : uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .",
                "D : this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button",
                "D : if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .",
                "D : Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen",
                "A : Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : be about th three and a half .",
                "B : what else can you do ?",
                "D : Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .",
                "D : but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .",
                "B : And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?",
                "D : Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <disfmarker>",
                "A : Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .",
                "A : Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .",
                "A : left-right balance ,",
                "A : um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes ,",
                "B : We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing ,",
                "B : and see if we need to",
                "B : um if we need to rethink anything at all .",
                "B : for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?",
                "B : Do we have kinetic as well ?",
                "A : No .",
                "B : And that's because of cost restraints is it ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "A : We need an advanced chip I think , yep .",
                "B : So we want double-curved ?",
                "A : I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .",
                "B : um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?",
                "A : For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .",
                "A : We've got push buttons as well .",
                "B : So we're w w quite far over .",
                "A : Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .",
                "B : something's gonna have to go .",
                "B : Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>",
                "A : The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",
                "A : so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,",
                "A : It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .",
                "A : or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .",
                "B : No can do .",
                "A : Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,",
                "B : And now we're under budget .",
                "D : sort of <vocalsound> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .",
                "B : width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?",
                "B : How how tall do you envisage it being ?",
                "B : About two centimetres , okay .",
                "C : Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .",
                "B : Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .",
                "C : but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,",
                "A : I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,",
                "A : so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .",
                "C : What about button shape ?",
                "C : Square buttons ?",
                "A : Yeah",
                "A : Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .",
                "B : discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points ,",
                "C : I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,",
                "C : and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,",
                "C : So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,",
                "C : uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,",
                "C : and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,",
                "C : So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .",
                "A : I rate that pretty highly .",
                "C : Okay let's go with five then .",
                "C : Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .",
                "C : Let's go with two point five then .",
                "C : high tech innovation .",
                "C : so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,",
                "C : but jog-dial",
                "B : Yeah about three , okay .",
                "C : Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .",
                "A : the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,",
                "A : Okay , the blue the blue colours and <disfmarker> don't re don't actually represent the colour ,",
                "C : so we'll go two .",
                "C : and um design is simple to use , simple in features .",
                "B : I mean I'd give that nearly a one .",
                "C : Um , <vocalsound> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?",
                "C : We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .",
                "D : Yeah I think it's about five .",
                "C : logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?",
                "C : And um it's within budget , yep .",
                "C : out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .",
                "C : We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .",
                "C : So it's pretty good .",
                "C : I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .",
                "C : It's not something I need to p push through ,",
                "C : but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker>",
                "B : uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .",
                "B : Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <vocalsound>",
                "B : Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?",
                "C : Yeah , yeah",
                "C : it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .",
                "B : But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .",
                "C : answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity",
                "C : We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,",
                "C : so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker>",
                "A : The constraints do come in very fast .",
                "D : it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .",
                "A : I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,",
                "A : and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker>",
                "A : it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .",
                "A : and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker>",
                "C : In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within .",
                "C : And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker>",
                "C : But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .",
                "A : I think the interactions are very structured .",
                "B : So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .",
                "A : I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,",
                "D : Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .",
                "B : uh what about teamwork ?",
                "D : If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .",
                "A : I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .",
                "C : I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork",
                "C : because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation",
                "C : I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,",
                "C : maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .",
                "C : I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype",
                "C : and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss",
                "C : and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,",
                "C : we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .",
                "A : I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,",
                "A : and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .",
                "A : And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally ,",
                "B : What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?",
                "D : Oh they're a bit clunky .",
                "A : Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well ,",
                "A : But I think the pen is v is very intuitive ,",
                "A : So I think the pen's good .",
                "C : And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .",
                "C : We only actually needed one computer .",
                "A : And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,",
                "C : , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .",
                "C : well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .",
                "B : I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on",
                "B : I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room ,",
                "B : and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c",
                "A : And we have Ninja Homer .",
                "B : Well apparently now I write the final report .",

                "B : Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design .",
                "B : Um <vocalsound> of the of the remote control .",
                "B : Um I've just got three sections ,",
                "B : first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um .",
                "B : And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote .",
                "B : Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .",
                "B : And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do",
                "B : and how it connects with the television .",
                "B : Um the basic components are an energy source",
                "B : which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply .",
                "B : Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary .",
                "B : We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "B : Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that .",
                "B : Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .",
                "B : And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .",
                "B : Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system",
                "B : but is not actually part of the remote itself ,",
                "B : because that's obviously found in the television .",
                "B : <gap> .",
                "B : Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board",
                "B : because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,",
                "B : so . I'll just go through there .",
                "B : S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ?",
                "B : Oh I'll j",
                "C : I think it's that little <disfmarker>",
                "A : Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think .",
                "B : Oh I see .",
                "B : Oh okay .",
                "B : I'll get rid of the bear",
                "A : <gap> it's magic . <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Okay that's great .",
                "B : Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl",
                "B : Uh no ,",
                "B : a power supply",
                "B : which we'd probably get <disfmarker>",
                "B : it's probably gonna be the battery .",
                "B : Um",
                "B : we then have a particular button ,",
                "B : which may be <disfmarker>",
                "B : <gap> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .",
                "B : Um but this is how the basic system works .",
                "B : Um that sends <gap>",
                "B : after you press that that sends the message to the chip ,",
                "B : which um then sends <disfmarker>",
                "B : It sort of interprets which button you've pressed",
                "B : and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <vocalsound>",
                "B : Um .",
                "B : So that's <gap> . That's the remote in itself ,",
                "B : that's the components of the remote",
                "B : and how they work together .",
                "B : So this is the uh user interface .",
                "B : Um this is the chip itself ,",
                "B : which then <gap> , and that's the that's the infra-red sender .",
                "B : And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver .",
                "B : And the sender sends a message to the receiver .",
                "B : 'Kay .",
                "A : So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? <gap> .",
                "B : Ah yes , that's the power source .",
                "B : Um .",
                "B : <gap> going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote ,",
                "B : just because of the size .",
                "B : You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Um and then the sender ,",
                "B : and infra-red um has been used quite successfully .",
                "B : If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well .",
                "B : You don't have to be point directly at the television itself .",
                "A : So the battery is the <disfmarker> in the sender .",
                "B : Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yes .",
                "B : 'Kay and that's it for the moment .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : So , now more design . <vocalsound>",
                "C : Right .",
                "C : Thank you .",
                "C : Mine's not quite as complicated as all that .",
                "A : <vocalsound> That's what we like to hear . <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Did I press function ?",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : Is it control function",
                "C : Oh .",
                "A : ei Oh , th there you go .",
                "C : Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design .",
                "C : I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .",
                "C : Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down ,",
                "C : uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that .",
                "C : Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .",
                "C : Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button .",
                "C : Um here are two example remotes .",
                "C : Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions ,",
                "C : so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about .",
                "C : Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated .",
                "C : Um whereas the right remote is much simpler ,",
                "C : it looks much more user friendly .",
                "C : Um so my personal preference would be the right remote .",
                "C : So , <vocalsound> it's got nice big buttons ,",
                "C : it's got a very limited number of buttons .",
                "C : Um they're nice ,",
                "C : kinda clearly labelled .",
                "C : Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that .",
                "C : So it's very very user friendly ,",
                "C : and it's got a little splash of colour .",
                "C : Could maybe do with some more colour .",
                "C : Um .",
                "A : Well there's a couple of things there .",
                "A : Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme .",
                "A : So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "C : Do we get to see that ?",
                "A : <vocalsound> I haven't as yet , no .",
                "C : Will you be presenting that in a bit ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : <vocalsound> But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan .",
                "A : So uh I'm guessing that uh uh",
                "A : I notice on the bottom there it's got uh",
                "A : what's that ?",
                "A : A_P_O_G_E_E_",
                "A : that might be the corporate colour scheme ,",
                "A : although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .",
                "B : <gap>",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "B : Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section ,",
                "B : because that seems to be for a video as well .",
                "B : So we could dispense with that little bit as well",
                "B : and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .",
                "C : What do you mean by the circular section ?",
                "B : Possibly ?",
                "C : Like all of that bottom bit ?",
                "B : J yeah yeah yeah j yeah",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : just this little bit",
                "B : is that <disfmarker>",
                "B : I think that's still um a video remote part ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : so maybe we could get rid of that as well .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .",
                "A : Well b uh w",
                "C : I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?",
                "C : I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .",
                "A : Well th the on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "C : Like how often do you hit nine ?",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,",
                "A : and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .",
                "B : It's just people are used to seeing that ,",
                "A : But but <disfmarker>",
                "B : so if we didn't have them then they might think it's <disfmarker> <gap>",
                "A : But ,",
                "A : well possibly",
                "A : but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,",
                "A : but uh I mean <vocalsound> how many channels do we have to um <disfmarker> actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ?",
                "A : I would have thought that uh <gap> it's forever expanding",
                "A : and at the moment we've got <disfmarker> although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "A : and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Hmm .",
                "A : So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather <disfmarker>",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "A : Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other ,",
                "A : but presumably it'll take a second",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : 'cause you have to be able to stop it .",
                "A : Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels",
                "A : that w",
                "A : and then you could dispense with more otherwise .",
                "A : Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .",

                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : <gap>",
                "A : Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting <disfmarker> rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty",
                "B : <gap>",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "A : and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want",

                "C : Mm . Um .",
                "A : Anyway .",
                "C : But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel ,",
                "C : and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .",
                "C : Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers <disfmarker>",
                "B : Okay , yeah .",

                "C : But I suppose nine's not really excessive .",
                "B : I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you <disfmarker> uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .",
                "C : I suppose it does make a good pattern .",
                "B : So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with <disfmarker>",

                "B : That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .",

                "A : Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market <vocalsound> was one of the considerations .",

                "B : <gap>",
                "D : Right ,",
                "D : we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .",
                "D : And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_",
                "D : and um how do people use it ?",
                "D : We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .",
                "D : Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them ,",
                "D : and what improvements would would they like to remote control .",
                "D : And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .",
                "D : And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly",
                "D : and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control",
                "D : And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all .",
                "D : People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .",
                "D : Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control .",
                "D : And young people were quite receptive to this ,",
                "D : but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age <disfmarker> forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .",
                "D : There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .",
                "D : Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls",
                "D : and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .",
                "D : And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <vocalsound>",
                "D : Okay , so <disfmarker>",
                "D : My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some <vocalsound> sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <disfmarker>",
                "D : A design which looks high-tech , basically .",
                "D : Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market ,",
                "D : and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .",
                "D : Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .",
                "D : That's worth thinking about .",
                "D : Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well ,",
                "D : because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design .",
                "D : That that might be the market that we're we're looking for .",
                "D : And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to <vocalsound> speech recognition to change the channels .",
                "D : 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise ,",
                "D : so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Okay um ,",
                "D : and that's the end of the slide show .",
                "D : That's it .",
                "D : Cool .",
                "C : Do <gap> a lot of um <disfmarker>",
                "A : What was that last wee bit there ?",
                "D : Um about speech recognition ?",
                "A : Speech recognition ,",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .",
                "D : Youn young people pref",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility",
                "D : and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .",
                "B : No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that",
                "B : and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .",
                "D : Yeah . Yeah .",
                "A : Well that's right .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have",
                "B : <disfmarker> You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .",
                "B : Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can <disfmarker> <gap> some kind of buzzer system between the two .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So you can press a button which is always kept in one place",
                "B : and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .",
                "D : Uh-huh .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,",
                "D : which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but <disfmarker>",
                "B : That is true , yes .",
                "B : Hmm .",
                "C : There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at ,",
                "C : I can't remember ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : and then they whistle back , or something like that .",
                "A : Sounds reasonable .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : That'd probably be really simple ,",
                "C : they're cheap .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Yeah . So <disfmarker>",
                "B : So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the <disfmarker>",
                "B : or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .",
                "A : Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .",
                "A : But if you <disfmarker>",
                "A : I know .",
                "A : Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .",
                "A : <vocalsound> You'd want to try and av just have the one product",
                "A : that if <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : Um I dunno um talking about vo",
                "A : I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way",
                "A : because it'll recognise the voice",
                "A : and you can give it a command ,",
                "A : a set command whatever that happened to be .",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then <disfmarker>",
                "B : <gap> you could have an option to turn it off . Or <disfmarker>",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Perhaps , um .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .",
                "A : Mm .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : So uh <vocalsound>",
                "A : Any sugges",
                "A : Well , any conclusions ?",
                "D : Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Mm .",
                "D : Considering <disfmarker>",
                "A : Well if it does then we can't .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : <vocalsound> It's that simple ,",
                "A : because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me",
                "A : whereby we had <disfmarker> The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned .",
                "A : We've got um the remote was only for the television",
                "A : and not for <disfmarker>",
                "A : because that would make it too complex",
                "A : and we have to get it market quickly .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "A : So that means that uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : 'Kay .",
                "A : so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : So we're being focused effectively directly at a television",
                "A : and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .",
                "B : Yes .",
                "A : So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick",
                "B : Has to be simple enough to <disfmarker>",
                "A : because time to market is is critical . S",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "B : <gap> I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : It would .",
                "A : But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .",
                "B : 'Kay .",
                "A : Added extras would be nice ,",
                "A : but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : which effectively now is sort of four hours .",
                "A : So <disfmarker> and if <disfmarker>",
                "A : and we've gotta get to the end .",
                "A : Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end",
                "A : and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "D : So <disfmarker>",
                "A : <gap>",
                "A : Right okay , uh so I need to <disfmarker>",
                "A : Right . So",
                "A : I don't know how long we have left of our uh time .",
                "A : But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions",
                "D : About five minutes .",
                "A : and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .",
                "B : Yes .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Um . <vocalsound>",
                "A : We'll also know w when the next meeting is",
                "A : I um <disfmarker> so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .",
                "A : And then we can report back at the next meeting",
                "A : and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Does that make reasonable sense ?",

                "D : Okay , yeah .",
                "A : So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing .",
                "A : And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Do it via the email",
                "D : Okay . Yep .",
                "A : so that rather than coming you know <disfmarker>",
                "A : If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine .",
                "A : Come along with it in the next meeting ,",
                "A : we can discuss it then",
                "A : and take whatever action is appropriate .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know",
                "A : 'cause that might have an impact on their uh <disfmarker> on what they come up with <vocalsound> effectively at the next meeting .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Right , is there <disfmarker>",
                "D : So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S",
                "A : I would guess so .",
                "C : Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Yeah",
                "D : and <disfmarker>",
                "C : 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .",
                "D : Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .",
                "A : I <vocalsound> w well uh i",
                "B : Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment ,",
                "A : Something simple .",
                "B : and if something comes back <disfmarker>",
                "A : Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short ,",
                "A : you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : something that's quick and simple .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : So ,",
                "C : And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either ,",
                "A : sounds good .",
                "C : 'cause everyone can whistle or clap ,",
                "C : and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology .",
                "A : Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,",
                "B : <gap>",
                "A : now something that doesn't like whis uh",
                "D : No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : Well I I I don't know .",
                "A : Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option ,",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : but if <disfmarker>",
                "A : I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle ,",
                "D : No ,",
                "D : clapping , I think clapping ,",
                "B : I'd go more <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : f more for clap .",
                "D : yeah . Yeah .",
                "A : so uh so clap option .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "C : 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?",
                "A : Uh .",
                "C : Is that one of the <disfmarker>",
                "A : Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying ,",
                "A : that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Taking out teletext , okay .",
                "A : so so take out teletext .",
                "B : Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers",
                "C : Right .",
                "B : and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .",
                "C : Yeah , I think so ,",
                "C : so zero to nine .",
                "D : Mm .",
                "D : I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : so you can press any two",
                "D : and it'll sort of put them together .",
                "B : Okay , ten numbers",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : and then some kind of device to allow uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : Or multiple digits .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : Did we decide anything about um the other functions ?",
                "B : As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ?",
                "B : You had an had an idea about the menu ?",
                "D : Uh <vocalsound> we could possibly put an L_ <disfmarker> a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in ,",
                "D : but that again is probably an expense that <disfmarker>",
                "B : But just thinking um people probably <disfmarker>",
                "B : I mean you don't have <disfmarker>",
                "B : you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once ,",
                "B : but you have to be able to tune it that once .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .",
                "B : You can't really avoid that .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "A : No .",
                "B : Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So that'll be in <disfmarker>",
                "A : But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic",
                "B : Yes .",
                "A : and if it is at the moment , that's fine .",
                "A : But at the moment it's not ,",
                "A : so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters ,",
                "A : 'cause otherwise it would make it <disfmarker> uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Yeah yeah .",
                "A : and the idea is to have an international market",
                "C : Mm .",
                "A : which is <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : And it's also m it's",
                "A : the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale ,",
                "A : so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : I s I suppose um",
                "D : if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote",
                "A : Possibly .",
                "D : 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so .",
                "D : I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,",
                "A : That's right .",
                "D : so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . <gap>",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : So how would this menu function work ?",
                "B : Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "D : that would be a good idea , yeah .",
                "C : like the volume or something .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well .",
                "C : My dad was watching a film the other week",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : and it was too dark ,",
                "C : so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up .",
                "B : <gap>",
                "B : <gap> we're gonna have the the individual numbers",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "B : and then a menu function",
                "B : and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide <disfmarker>",
                "B : Presu uh",
                "B : I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu <gap> use different buttons",
                "B : you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .",
                "D : Uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet",
                "D : 'cause one <disfmarker> the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Right , okay um .",
                "D : So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it ,",
                "D : so you're basically pressing <disfmarker>",
                "B : <gap> that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two ,",
                "B : and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff",
                "B : which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .",
                "D : Right .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "C : Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?",
                "A : Okay , well .",
                "A : Mm .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : So y",
                "C : So you don't use it that much ,",
                "A : Ah That's a very good idea .",
                "C : you don't have to see it all the time .",
                "C : But it's all there if you need it .",
                "B : That is that is a good idea actually .",
                "D : Yeah , yeah .",
                "B : Sor sort of a second .",
                "A : So you keep um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Like a hidden panel .",
                "A : Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : I don't know if you've got the same .",
                "B : Uh not quite , but I guess <gap> .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .",
                "B : Keep the other buttons but hide them away .",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "C : And that'll be better for the older generation as well",
                "C : 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu ,",
                "A : Ah .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly .",

                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So um <vocalsound> we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well .",
                "B : So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .",
                "D : Yeah .",

                "D : The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : uh sorta <disfmarker>",
                "A : That's right",

                "B : Okay , so we'll have um <disfmarker>",

                "C : Yeah .",

                "D : So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah .",
                "B : Oh yeah",
                "B : and th and a enter button just to select .",
                "B : Yeah , okay .",
                "B : Um I guess we're keeping s it simple .",
                "B : We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions",
                "B : because it's just volume up , volume down .",
                "A : Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so .",
                "B : Um .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .",

                "A : Okay .",
                "B : Do they have their own <disfmarker> do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,",
                "C : Um maybe for the younger market .",
                "B : or do you have to do it via the remote ?",
                "C : Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .",
                "B : Yeah I suppose if we've got their <disfmarker> if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .",
                "A : Yeah . Yeah .",
                "C : Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote .",
                "B : Oh , okay .",
                "B : Right .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : But I don't really know what they're for ,",

                "C : I just know they're something to do with Dolby .",
                "B : Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think <disfmarker>",
                "A : Well you might get some research . <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",

                "B : And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote .",
                "B : Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .",
                "B : And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do",
                "B : Um the basic components are an energy source",
                "B : which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply .",
                "B : We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote .",
                "B : Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that .",
                "B : Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .",
                "B : And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .",
                "B : Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system",
                "B : because that's obviously found in the television .",
                "B : Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board",
                "B : because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,",
                "B : a power supply",
                "B : we then have a particular button ,",
                "B : <gap> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .",
                "B : after you press that that sends the message to the chip ,",
                "B : and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <vocalsound>",
                "B : that's the components of the remote",
                "B : So this is the uh user interface .",
                "B : And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver .",
                "B : which then <gap> , and that's the that's the infra-red sender .",
                "B : <gap> going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote ,",
                "B : just because of the size .",
                "B : and infra-red um has been used quite successfully .",
                "B : Um and then the sender ,",
                "C : Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .",
                "C : Um here are two example remotes .",
                "C : Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions ,",
                "C : so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about .",
                "C : Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated .",
                "C : Um whereas the right remote is much simpler ,",
                "C : it looks much more user friendly .",
                "C : Um so my personal preference would be the right remote .",
                "C : it's got a very limited number of buttons .",
                "C : So , <vocalsound> it's got nice big buttons ,",
                "C : Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that .",
                "C : So it's very very user friendly ,",
                "A : <vocalsound> But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan .",
                "A : Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme .",
                "B : Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section ,",
                "B : So we could dispense with that little bit as well",
                "B : because that seems to be for a video as well .",
                "B : and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .",
                "C : And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .",
                "C : I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?",
                "C : I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .",
                "A : Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,",
                "A : and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .",
                "A : but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,",
                "A : and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .",
                "A : Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels",
                "C : Um some remotes have kind of favourite options",
                "A : Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting <disfmarker> rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty",
                "A : and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want",
                "C : But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel ,",
                "C : and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .",
                "A : Limit the number of buttons ,",
                "C : But I suppose nine's not really excessive .",
                "A : you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever ,",
                "B : How many buttons have we got ?",
                "B : We've just got ten , eleven twelve th",
                "A : Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market <vocalsound> was one of the considerations .",
                "D : we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .",
                "D : and um how do people use it ?",
                "D : We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .",
                "D : And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .",
                "D : And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly",
                "D : and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control",
                "D : And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all .",
                "D : People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .",
                "D : Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control .",
                "D : And young people were quite receptive to this ,",
                "D : but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age <disfmarker> forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .",
                "D : There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .",
                "D : and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .",
                "D : And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <vocalsound>",
                "D : My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some <vocalsound> sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market ,",
                "D : and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .",
                "D : Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .",
                "D : Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well ,",
                "D : because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design .",
                "D : And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to <vocalsound> speech recognition to change the channels .",
                "D : 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise ,",
                "D : so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .",
                "A : What was that last wee bit there ?",
                "D : Um about speech recognition ?",
                "A : But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .",
                "B : and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .",
                "B : And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have",
                "B : <disfmarker> You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .",
                "B : Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can <disfmarker> <gap> some kind of buzzer system between the two .",
                "B : So you can press a button which is always kept in one place",
                "B : and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .",
                "D : Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,",
                "C : There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at ,",
                "C : and then they whistle back , or something like that .",
                "C : That'd probably be really simple ,",
                "A : Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .",
                "B : or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .",
                "A : I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way",
                "A : Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .",
                "A : a set command whatever that happened to be .",
                "A : and you can give it a command ,",
                "A : because it'll recognise the voice",
                "B : <gap> you could have an option to turn it off . Or <disfmarker>",
                "B : So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .",
                "D : Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?",
                "A : Well if it does then we can't .",
                "A : and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .",
                "A : So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick",
                "A : because time to market is is critical . S",
                "A : But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .",
                "A : Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end",
                "A : and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .",
                "A : But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions",
                "A : and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .",
                "A : And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .",
                "A : If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine .",
                "A : But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know",
                "A : Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "A : On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,",
                "C : Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .",
                "C : I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .",
                "D : clapping , I think clapping ,",
                "C : 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?",
                "B : Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers",
                "B : and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .",
                "D : I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,",
                "B : I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .",
                "D : Uh <vocalsound> we could possibly put an L_ <disfmarker> a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in ,",
                "D : but that again is probably an expense that <disfmarker>",
                "B : you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once ,",
                "B : So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .",
                "A : the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale ,",
                "A : so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech .",
                "D : I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,",
                "D : so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . <gap>",
                "B : Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .",
                "C : Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well .",
                "C : Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?",
                "C : So you don't use it that much ,",
                "B : That is that is a good idea actually .",
                "A : So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .",
                "C : And that'll be better for the older generation as well",
                "B : So um <vocalsound> we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well .",
                "D : The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,",
                "A : So on front ,",
                "B : <gap> about the number <gap> .",
                "B : Um the volume up and down .",
                "B : A mute button as well .",
                "D : And probably a power one as well .",
                "C : I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity <gap> .",
                "C : Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .",
                "C : Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here .",
                "B : But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one .",
                "A : <vocalsound> So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?",
                "B : Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?",
                "D : Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .",
                "B : So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?",
                "D : Numbers is ten ,",
                "D : volume is twelve ,",
                "D : And a mute , yeah .",
                "A : And then at the back ?",
                "D : You've got brightness and contrast .",
                "B : Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .",
                "C : Uh there's audio functions .",
                "A : You're also gonna have the channel tuner <gap> , as it were .",
                "D : And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .",
                "C : So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .",
                "B : Do they have their own <disfmarker> do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,",
                "C : Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .",
                "B : Yeah I suppose if we've got their <disfmarker> if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .",
                "A : Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .",
                "B : Well shall we look into that and just get back together ."

                "A : Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television ,",

                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "A : so uh that's one thing to keep in mind .",

                "A : Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert ,",
                "A : uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older ,",
                "A : but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh <disfmarker> would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty .",

                "A : I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now",

                "A : we have uh forty minutes ,",

                "D : Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent .",
                "D : Mm <vocalsound> and some interests from the from the age groups ,",
                "D : uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition .",
                "D : I don't think that's uh really appropriate .",
                "D : Um , <vocalsound> and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh <disfmarker> Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .",
                "D : Second findings <vocalsound> out of the questionnaire um are the opinion <vocalsound> the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls .",
                "D : First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly ,",
                "D : uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .",
                "D : So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer .",
                "D : Okay ,",
                "D : third findings .",
                "D : According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um <vocalsound> following buttons are most important .",
                "D : Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done .",
                "D : Um , <vocalsound> persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour ,",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons .",
                "D : Um , when you multiply them , you get the <disfmarker> these three points .",
                "D : Switching channels , um yeah ,",
                "D : that's pretty uh pretty normal ,",
                "D : that's what you do with a remote control .",
                "D : Um the second , teletext ,",
                "D : uh and the third , uh volume controls .",
                "D : Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want <disfmarker> wants ,",
                "D : uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear .",
                "A : But it's strange that the the manage board <disfmarker> the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet .",
                "D : Yeah , okay .",
                "A : So that that's strange .",
                "D : Yeah , okay ,",
                "D : but uh at the moment uh teletext is <disfmarker> Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information .",
                "A : Yeah , okay .",
                "D : So uh ,",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : when you ask people , what do they use ,",
                "D : <vocalsound> they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : Yeah , okay .",
                "D : That's ridiculous . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : That's a ne i it <disfmarker>",
                "D : It's a new technology ,",
                "D : but it's not incorporated right now .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : Okay ,",
                "D : my personal preferences . Um ,",
                "D : I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent .",
                "D : Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it .",
                "D : Um , yeah ,",
                "D : people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder .",
                "D : Um <vocalsound> second point , <vocalsound>",
                "D : we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .",
                "D : Third point um that came out of the uh <disfmarker> of the questionnaire ,",
                "D : uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller ,",
                "D : so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_",
                "A : Yeah ,",
                "A : that's a cool idea .",
                "D : where you can put the the remote control in .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah .",
                "C : When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that",
                "D : Uh not not the r not the functions ,",
                "C : what what are you think about ?",
                "D : but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Uh , the funtionability .",
                "D : So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons ,",
                "D : but if you don't use them , yeah it's <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Ah okay ,",
                "C : so focusing more on the used buttons .",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : they have to be on it",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : j just to t to get it done if necessary ,",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "D : but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or <disfmarker>",
                "C : Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions ,",
                "C : like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .",
                "D : Yeah , perhaps .",
                "D : Just for the minor functions perhaps .",
                "C : Thank you .",
                "C : Yeah , ma perhaps ,",
                "C : just just an idea .",
                "D : Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah ?",
                "D : 'Kay ,",
                "D : that's it .",
                "A : Thank you , Tim .",
                "A : <vocalsound> Janus , can you uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure .",
                "C : Right uh ,",
                "C : I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project .",
                "C : Well uh",
                "C : what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls",
                "C : and um I viewed how how they w looked ,",
                "C : how they worked ,",
                "C : uh what kind of components are involved ,",
                "C : and how they are connected together .",
                "C : And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised",
                "C : and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds .",
                "C : And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works",
                "C : and how we could uh build one",
                "C : and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .",
                "C : Um right . Uh well",
                "C : what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls",
                "C : and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared ,",
                "C : not like all probably know .",
                "C : And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something ,",
                "C : and those uh have a transmitter",
                "C : that's also focused on infrared ,",
                "C : so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate ,",
                "C : so that would mean extra cost for the user",
                "C : and thus uh that's",
                "C : that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us .",
                "C : So that's probably why most controls are still infrared .",
                "C : Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure ,",
                "C : so that would probably uh mean lower costs",
                "C : and uh",
                "C : i",
                "C : that could mean for us a good thing",
                "C : uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh <gap> a cheap uh remote .",
                "C : Well uh",
                "C : as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth <disfmarker>",
                "C : Well",
                "C : it may be possible ,",
                "C : but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in <disfmarker> within our budget ,",
                "C : but that's not for me to decide ,",
                "C : but that's maybe something for marketing to look into .",
                "C : F",
                "C : because uh <disfmarker> well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth <gap> or or radio waves ,",
                "C : <vocalsound> although <disfmarker>",
                "D : What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : actually I have t",
                "D : So it's in the wrong product .",
                "C : Yeah . Yeah ,",
                "C : I actually <disfmarker> I figured that would be that would be rather nice ,",
                "C : but then you'd still have the uh <disfmarker> the infrared function .",
                "C : So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote .",
                "C : If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound> Yeah .",
                "C : I dunno ,",
                "C : maybe uh maybe something to look into ,",
                "C : I dunno uh what the cost <gap> that something like that would be .",
                "C : But it may be uh may be something to explore .",
                "C : Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components .",
                "C : Uh first you have the energy source .",
                "C : The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery",
                "C : uh that you can find anywhere .",
                "C : I figured that would be best ,",
                "C : 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use <disfmarker> you could just go out and buy a new one .",
                "C : So we didn't <disfmarker> and we don't have to do all uh <disfmarker> to be too complicated about that .",
                "C : Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button ,",
                "C : but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <disfmarker>",
                "C : there is a switch uh between these .",
                "C : When the switch is pressed in a w on this",
                "C : this case it switches a button ,",
                "C : when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here ,",
                "C : and in uh <disfmarker> immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh",
                "C : displaying to the user that something has happened .",
                "C : That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh .",
                "C : Or I press button",
                "C : but nothing's happening on the T_V_ ,",
                "C : so is is something wrong or something .",
                "C : So that's just to uh to to explain the <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> to to uh make it clearer to the user .",
                "C : Uh w well",
                "C : the signal goes via chip",
                "C : that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals",
                "C : and then it's processed",
                "C : and then it's sent to the infrared bulb",
                "C : where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end .",
                "C : And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television .",
                "C : Uh well",
                "C : my personal preferences here ,",
                "C : well",
                "C : we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions ,",
                "C : just like you said",
                "C : uh <disfmarker> well",
                "C : the most users n",
                "C : uh you have a lot of buttons",
                "C : and you u u use <disfmarker> you don't use them ,",
                "C : so why why should we invent uh <disfmarker> w spend more time on those .",
                "C : Uh I I think we should stick by <disfmarker> with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving .",
                "C : So uh",
                "C : no input from the television .",
                "C : So",
                "C : I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that ,",
                "C : because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too ,",
                "C : and so",
                "C : in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such .",
                "C : So",
                "C : I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time",
                "C : and <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um , yeah ,",
                "D : maybe another problem uh ,",
                "D : I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .",
                "C : Yes ,",
                "C : but what should we uh s I I I f",
                "C : I agree with you ,",
                "C : but should we spend money or <disfmarker> and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?",
                "D : Huh .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : 'Cause that would be <disfmarker> I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account .",
                "C : So I I <disfmarker> my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all .",
                "C : Um , well",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : we should uh look into the design and the functionability .",
                "C : Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions ,",
                "C : or well uh",
                "C : just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh <gap> stuff .",
                "C : And uh don't overbuild ,",
                "C : we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions ,",
                "C : but we we should stick to the basics .",
                "C : So that was my uh my personal opinion .",
                "C : And that was my uh my presentation uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : Okay ,",
                "A : thank you Janus .",
                "B : Yes ,",
                "B : I can go ahead .",
                "A : You do ?",
                "A : The last presentation .",
                "B : Last presentation . Okay .",
                "A : You have plenty of time ,",
                "A : Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes ,",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : so uh",
                "A : take your time .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : <gap>",
                "A : If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : warn you .",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Well ,",
                "B : I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .",
                "B : Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one ,",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh <disfmarker> if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness ,",
                "B : so tha that's that's some of the main points .",
                "B : And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult ,",
                "B : so use as as little functions as possible",
                "B : or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .",
                "B : If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time ,",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "B : 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see ,",
                "B : but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen ,",
                "B : but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "B : since we are sticking to uh um infrared",
                "B : and and the remote cannot receive anything ,",
                "B : but uh we might uh consider that .",
                "B : Um well ,",
                "B : of course I I hope this is all clear to you .",
                "B : If you <disfmarker>",
                "B : you can use remote like this with all the functions ,",
                "B : <gap> many functions ,",
                "B : but <disfmarker> Well ,",
                "B : your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this .",
                "B : You have to be very careful what you push ,",
                "D : <vocalsound> <vocalsound>",
                "B : and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour",
                "B : from",
                "B : uh um <disfmarker> yeah well ,",
                "B : where is it ? Where the hell <disfmarker>",
                "B : he here I guess",
                "B : and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else .",
                "B : So just keep it simple ,",
                "B : make clear buttons , easy to use .",
                "B : For example if you want to use a play and back and stop ,",
                "B : that's very important .",
                "B : Um well",
                "B : this was because of our last discussion ,",
                "B : if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines ,",
                "B : but um it's no longer uh applying .",
                "B : <vocalsound> Well yeah ,",
                "B : I prefer to use it only for T_V_",
                "B : and um n uh",
                "B : not to give too many options",

                "A : so uh",
                "B : and so that's where the difficulties lie .",

                "A : you you want to keep it simple ,",
                "C : but <disfmarker>",
                "A : but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one .",

                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Okay .",

                "D : Mm-hmm .",

                "C : but <disfmarker>",
                "D : but <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "D : and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus ,",
                "D : and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .",

                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Well",

                "C : And that would be uh a considerable problem .",

                "B : if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Use big clear buttons . Not too many .",
                "B : So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options ,",
                "B : but I think i this is more important . Um",
                "B : <vocalsound> especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once",
                "B : and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .",
                "C : Not embed",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : but then with something like a touch screen could <disfmarker> could make more menu up <disfmarker> pop up or something .",

                "B : if you want to uh uh s put <gap> on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do .",

                "B : as you already told , give some feedback .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .",
                "B : And um , well ,",
                "B : my conclusion is uh is uh less is more ,",
                "B : keep it simple .",
                "B : So uh",
                "B : maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible",
                "B : on t",
                "B : because you all know , if there are a lot of function <gap> on the the television ,",
                "B : some you you'll never know",
                "B : uh and never use ,",
                "B : and therefore it's uh important",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy",
                "B : and other functions um that are not so important <disfmarker> um well you <disfmarker> we should consider just not using them",
                "B : or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .",
                "D : Yeah . Uh ,",
                "D : I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good .",
                "D : Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people .",
                "D : Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up ,",
                "D : um and that's a big ad advantage I think ,",
                "D : because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : It's uh",
                "D : very visual intended .",
                "D : <vocalsound> What was I to say more ?",
                "B : Maybe that's an option .",
                "B : Um keep the primary buttons visible .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands",
                "B : and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it",
                "B : and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : and maybe use a touch screen ,",
                "B : or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh",
                "B : like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah okay ,",
                "D : but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?",
                "C : The extra functions .",
                "B : The extra functions ,",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "B : you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,",
                "D : but l like menu functions or <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : and then all all the options will become available",
                "D : Ah okay .",
                "B : and you just c s yeah t scroll through them .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet",
                "D : Yeah , I think so .",
                "C : and uh I'll just make um <disfmarker> uh let's say fifteen buttons on it ,",
                "C : and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with <disfmarker> or sub-items , sub-functions .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : Well um",
                "B : then I'd like to make a proposal .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : If you make one big touch screen ,",
                "C : Yes .",
                "B : use the same concept as here ,",
                "B : keep the buttons always available",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .",
                "C : Yeah , yeah ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : like like the iPod idea that that we just saw .",
                "B : Yeah . <vocalsound>",
                "C : You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus ,",
                "C : and with this idea you could actually make uh several <disfmarker> you can also improve uh later on .",
                "B : Yes .",
                "C : Uh uh I think that will be great .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .",
                "D : Yeah , I think so .",
                "C : Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the <disfmarker>",
                "A : Jirun ?",
                "B : Okay , I agree ,",
                "B : but I think it's very important",
                "B : that they always um make the same buttons accessible ,",
                "B : so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .",
                "D : Yeah , of course .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : And so um an elder designer picks up th the <disfmarker> of",
                "B : an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .",
                "A : Yeah yeah yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : like building in uh some kind of PIN code",
                "D : uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : but children",
                "D : uh <disfmarker> if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah",
                "B : wh",
                "B : Is that possible to use or no ?",
                "C : That is possible ,",
                "C : that <disfmarker>",
                "C : well",
                "D : Th there's just <disfmarker>",
                "C : that actually depends on the television ,",
                "C : but I think <disfmarker> I figure that would be <disfmarker>",
                "B : Well , yeah well ,",
                "B : does it have to depend on the television ?",
                "D : Ju just a simple log-in , something like that .",
                "C : Well ,",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : y you s you see the fi uh",
                "C : thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : the the channels are different on each te television ,",
                "C : they aren't set in a preset order ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : so uh",
                "C : if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : Yeah , okay .",
                "C : so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern .",
                "A : Yeah . Yeah .",
                "B : Well ,",
                "B : I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh <disfmarker> make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match ,",
                "B : and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords",
                "B : as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh <disfmarker> change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : and uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah , th that kind of stuff ,",
                "D : but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Yes .",
                "D : and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen ,",
                "D : that's uh",
                "D : vi violent channel ,",
                "B : Oh , something like that .",
                "C : Yes .",
                "D : uh m my ki my kids uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : I don't want my kids to watch that ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : then you set the priority to only parents ,",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : Okay , yeah .",

                "C : Yeah ,",
                "B : b but make it a separate option in the menu ,",

                "C : that would b",
                "D : But <disfmarker>",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah , that .",
                "B : so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh <disfmarker> displayed here ,",
                "D : Yeah okay ,",
                "D : but but <disfmarker> yeah , that's just",
                "B : so uh",
                "D : that's an a an added feature .",
                "B : parents uh <disfmarker>",

                "A : Okay .",
                "A : But let's not uh go too wide about the <disfmarker> those things ,",

                "A : It's it's a nice idea ,",
                "A : but I think that's we wel <vocalsound> later in the stage .",
                "A : I've one little question about um a total touch screen",
                "A : or uh um a p",
                "D : Partial .",
                "A : yeah , a partial ,",
                "A : uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen ,",
                "A : so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : uh and uh <vocalsound> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible .",
                "D : Yeah ,",

                "C : and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared ,",
                "C : And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something ,",
                "C : and those uh have a transmitter",
                "C : that's also focused on infrared ,",
                "C : so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate ,",
                "C : so that would mean extra cost for the user",
                "C : So that's probably why most controls are still infrared .",
                "C : Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure ,",
                "C : uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh <gap> a cheap uh remote .",
                "C : because uh <disfmarker> well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth <gap> or or radio waves ,",
                "D : What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?",
                "C : I actually <disfmarker> I figured that would be that would be rather nice ,",
                "C : but then you'd still have the uh <disfmarker> the infrared function .",
                "C : but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote .",
                "C : If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,",
                "C : maybe uh maybe something to look into ,",
                "C : I dunno uh what the cost <gap> that something like that would be .",
                "C : Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components .",
                "C : The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery",
                "C : I figured that would be best ,",
                "C : Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button ,",
                "C : but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <disfmarker>",
                "C : when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here ,",
                "C : and in uh <disfmarker> immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh",
                "C : displaying to the user that something has happened .",
                "C : That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh .",
                "C : the signal goes via chip",
                "C : that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals",
                "C : and then it's processed",
                "C : and then it's sent to the infrared bulb",
                "C : my personal preferences here ,",
                "C : we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions ,",
                "C : Uh I I think we should stick by <disfmarker> with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving .",
                "C : I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that ,",
                "C : because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too ,",
                "D : I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .",
                "C : but should we spend money or <disfmarker> and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?",
                "C : 'Cause that would be <disfmarker> I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .",
                "C : So I I <disfmarker> my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all .",
                "C : we should uh look into the design and the functionability .",
                "C : Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions ,",
                "C : just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh <gap> stuff .",
                "C : we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions ,",
                "C : but we we should stick to the basics .",
                "B : I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .",
                "B : Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one ,",
                "B : so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh <disfmarker> if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness ,",
                "B : And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult ,",
                "B : so use as as little functions as possible",
                "B : or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .",
                "B : And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen ,",
                "B : but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,",
                "B : since we are sticking to uh um infrared",
                "B : and and the remote cannot receive anything ,",
                "B : but uh we might uh consider that .",
                "B : So just keep it simple ,",
                "B : make clear buttons , easy to use .",
                "B : I prefer to use it only for T_V_",
                "B : and and if possible , uh the buttons should give <vocalsound> a dr direct action , not first select <disfmarker>",
                "A : you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one ,",
                "B : and so that's where the difficulties lie .",
                "B : Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought ,",
                "B : or do we want to use um many buttons .",
                "D : it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ <vocalsound> or a touch screen um ,",
                "D : that in the middle are the the main keys ,",
                "D : just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching ,",
                "D : and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or <disfmarker> that you can drop down .",
                "B : Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ?",
                "B : Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ?",
                "B : 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .",
                "B : if you use many options in one buttle <disfmarker> button , um display the menu on the T_V_",
                "B : and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,",
                "B : is too complicated for most users .",
                "D : and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .",
                "C : you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not <disfmarker>",
                "C : our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .",
                "C : but then with something like a touch screen could <disfmarker> could make more menu up <disfmarker> pop up or something .",
                "B : <vocalsound> especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once",
                "B : and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .",
                "B : maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible",
                "B : If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .",
                "D : I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good .",
                "D : Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people .",
                "D : Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up ,",
                "D : because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .",
                "B : Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands",
                "D : then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?",
                "C : The extra functions .",
                "B : you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,",
                "C : <vocalsound> Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet",
                "C : and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with <disfmarker> or sub-items , sub-functions .",
                "B : then I'd like to make a proposal .",
                "B : If you make one big touch screen ,",
                "B : keep the buttons always available",
                "B : and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .",
                "A : So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .",
                "B : that they always um make the same buttons accessible ,",
                "B : so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .",
                "B : an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .",
                "D : I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,",
                "D : like building in uh some kind of PIN code",
                "D : uh <disfmarker> if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or <disfmarker>",
                "B : Is that possible to use or no ?",
                "C : that actually depends on the television ,",
                "C : thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels ,",
                "C : the the channels are different on each te television ,",
                "D : th th those things are nice . <vocalsound>",
                "A : but I think that's we wel <vocalsound> later in the stage .",
                "A : uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen ,",
                "A : so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals",
                "A : uh and uh <vocalsound> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen ,",
                "D : but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers",
                "B : You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .",
                "C : but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience .",
                "C : W we are aiming for younger people",
                "D : And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff ,",
                "D : A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications .",
                "D : I th I think we can do that too .",
                "A : Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think .",
                "A : as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <vocalsound> are done .",
                "A : Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look",
                "A : we must keep it simple ,",
                "A : but have the opportunity to uh have more options",
                "A : and have them uh hidden or something ,",
                "A : the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the <disfmarker> done by the remote control and not by the television .",
                "B : then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume",
                "B : and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is ,",
                "B : there are universal d um um remotes",
                "B : and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s ,",
                "A : And it's not too complex to do it .",
                "C : they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_",
                "C : and that that is bit of a tricky job .",
                "D : Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press <disfmarker> yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ .",
                "B : In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes .",
                "B : if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up ,",
                "D : maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection ,",
                "D : so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_",
                "D : But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote <disfmarker>",
                "B : Well then you have to buy a new one ,",
                "B : or an update , software update .",
                "C : Or you could <disfmarker> well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier ,",
                "C : then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh <disfmarker> well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in ,",
                "C : it it would be uh bringing more costs <gap> uh with with it",
                "B : Um m for which one are we going ? <gap>",
                "C : my vote goes out to the right <gap> .",
                "B : I was uh doubting about which one to take ,",
                "B : but uh you've convinced me",
                "B : that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do .",
                "D : And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open .",

                "A : As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board .",
                "A : Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side .",
                "A : Here are some functions .",
                "A : You can save .",
                "A : uh these functions we don't have anything to do with ,",
                "A : only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing .",
                "A : A blank new document for each person .",

                "A : Uh then we've got our pen . This pen .",
                "A : It's really funny",
                "A : You can also select the current colour and the line width .",
                "A : and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .",
                "A : We've got our shared folder ,",
                "A : But all you will found that already",
                "A : because there are a lot of documents in it already ,",
                "A : so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .",
                "A : Here is a simple tool bar .",
                "A : it's save , print , move back or forward one page .",

                "A : <vocalsound> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .",
                "A : Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .",
                "A : You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child .",
                "A : Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked",
                "A : Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow .",
                "A : 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up .",
                "A : we choose form of current colour",
                "A : uh I think grey is appropriate .",

                "D : Gonna use a different line width .",
                "A : Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think .",
                "D : You have to go really slow when you're writing .",

                "A : move along to the project finance .",
                "A : Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price .",
                "A : Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros .",
                "A : Uh we can do it international ,",
                "A : so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well .",
                "A : Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros ,",
                "A : just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros .",
                "A : that's leads us to our little discussion .",
                "A : does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ?",
                "C : No , me neither .",
                "D : kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player ,",
                "D : so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player .",
                "D : And I think it's <disfmarker> it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .",
                "A : I've I've got one at home .",
                "A : And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it ,",
                "A : I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well .",
                "A : we've <disfmarker> we want different functions",
                "A : uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red .",
                "A : And it also operates on infra-red ,",
                "A : and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .",
                "A : so you have to got the little device inside your room ,",
                "D : Think it has to be shock proof",
                "B : Sure , yeah .",
                "D : my remote control tends to fall a lot .",
                "B : Waterproof ,",
                "A : Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .",
                "D : Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .",
                "D : how much is left in the battery .",
                "D : But they'll also really drag up the production costs ,",
                "D : so think we'll have to see about that too .",
                "D : But maybe just a little LED ,",
                "A : then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,",

                "B : Time , yeah .",
                "A : Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty ,",

                "B : w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .",
                "B : <vocalsound> Uh the method of the remote control is just <disfmarker>",
                "B : the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .",
                "B : So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "B : Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls ,",
                "B : the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .",

                "B : <vocalsound> Um but um <disfmarker> yeah .",
                "B : My personal preferences were ease of uh <disfmarker> the easy to use remote control ,",
                "B : because uh the user-friendliness and uh <disfmarker> it can be more trendy in in user design .",
                "B : But um your new goal f was for uh people than <disfmarker> less than forty years old .",
                "A : Uh-huh .",
                "B : So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design .",
                "B : But it should b I think it should be a combination ,",
                "B : but teletext buttons are not uh in our design .",
                "B : So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .",
                "B : But my <disfmarker> in <gap> my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : Uh Ruud , did you get that ?",

                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : the important thing here is <disfmarker>",
                "B : <vocalsound> And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .",
                "D : Oh ,",

                "A : w we will s we all uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .",

                "C : Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set .",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "C : And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set .",

                "C : which generates messages using uh infrared light ,",
                "C : which are sent to the receiver .",
                "C : That's basically the idea .",
                "C : And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . <vocalsound>",

                "C : what have I found .",
                "C : Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board ,",
                "C : um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "C : And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .",
                "B : <vocalsound> And what's the um <disfmarker>",
                "C : I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .",
                "B : if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy",

                "B : For the same costs ,",
                "C : Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive ,",
                "B : it's can be uh in our <disfmarker>",
                "C : but by uh um um making <disfmarker>",
                "B : Combined with the low-cost circuit board",

                "A : Yeah ,",

                "C : there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Um have a think about it .",

                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Okay well ,",
                "D : <vocalsound> Since uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : So any income is welcome . <vocalsound> Input .",
                "D : Okay ,",
                "D : make <disfmarker>",
                "D : Well <disfmarker> Uh",
                "D : then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .",
                "D : Of <gap> <disfmarker> of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .",
                "B : Could you step a little bit more to the right ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : Okay .",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "D : But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market ,",
                "B : thank you . <vocalsound>",
                "D : I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .",
                "D : But uh since uh the requirements changed ,",
                "D : that's uh not a good idea .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Uh well ,",
                "D : skip this . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah . <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Well ,",
                "D : it's <disfmarker>",
                "D : this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons .",
                "D : The buttons to zap are used the <disfmarker> about uh fifteen hundred times ,",
                "D : when uh the power button is only used one time .",
                "D : And the volume button's only four times .",
                "D : So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .",
                "D : And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .",
                "C : Mm .",
                "D : So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "D : Or <disfmarker>",
                "A : Well ,",
                "A : that's interesting .",
                "C : Or a find <disfmarker> a finding function ,",

                "C : you know .",

                "D : and he also said it .",
                "A : Okay . So",
                "A : that's what the market tells us .",
                "D : Uh that's about it , yes .",
                "A : Yep . Okay .",
                "B : The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used .",
                "D : Uh mo uh zap buttons most .",
                "B : So <disfmarker>",
                "D : Volume , they are <gap> uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah , well",
                "B : it should just have a design <disfmarker> The perfect design for those <disfmarker> only those buttons .",
                "C : Yes .",

                "C : Yes , we should focus on that , I guess .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "C : Well ,",

                "C : There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .",
                "C : So um",
                "C : I don't think we have any hiccups there .",
                "C : So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs .",
                "C : So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : the sound signal .",

                "C : Well",
                "C : Yes . <vocalsound> Th that's a bit of <disfmarker> that's a problem .",
                "B : <vocalsound> Another device is not a solution .",
                "A : Well",
                "A : maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",
                "C : Usually <disfmarker>",
                "B : It should be uh uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : like um turning on and off the the the lights .",
                "C : Oh yes .",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .",
                "C : Yes . Well ,",
                "C : there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already .",
                "C : Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button .",
                "C : You press it",
                "C : and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound ,",
                "C : and your uh remote controls then start to beep .",
                "A : Reports rep respend response to it .",
                "C : And um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : just like uh the phones",
                "C : Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing .",
                "B : the <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : But uh th",
                "B : But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : No ,",
                "C : so we we should use something else .",
                "D : And you <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "A : Yeah ,",
                "D : and usually <disfmarker>",
                "A : because we do not have a a a a a home um <disfmarker>",
                "B : But I believe you will have an <disfmarker>",
                "C : We do not control the T_V_ set so well .",
                "D : And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,",
                "C : Yes , m yes .",
                "C : S",
                "C : and we b we want <gap> to make so it's <gap> <disfmarker> is easy as possible for our customers ,",

                "A : Okay .",
                "C : so we should think about <disfmarker>",
                "A : So",
                "A : what about the clapping technique ?",
                "A : Um because you se",
                "B : I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .",
                "C : <vocalsound> It's quite complicated .",

                "C : it's quite complicated .",
                "D : <vocalsound> And b",
                "C : Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .",
                "A : Well ,",
                "A : you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yes , yes .",
                "C : Well , basically",
                "C : the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound ,",
                "A : Yeah , a peak . Yeah .",
                "C : which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .",
                "D : So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .",
                "A : Yeah , that's true .",
                "C : Yes ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : so we don't want that .",
                "B : But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .",
                "C : Maybe we can <disfmarker>",
                "C : Something like that .",
                "B : Well",
                "C : Well ,",
                "B : if you lost th",
                "C : is there not something f something more easily <disfmarker>",
                "A : Well uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the <disfmarker> their remote .",
                "C : Well ,",
                "C : I don't think uh <gap> .",
                "B : Uh that's just uh <disfmarker>",

                "C : and y the",
                "C : the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh <gap> . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,",

                "C : so",
                "C : w we should use have <disfmarker>",

                "C : Because I don't think <disfmarker>",

                "C : I can imagine when",
                "B : Uh and I think the most <disfmarker>",
                "A : I agree actually . <vocalsound>",
                "C : I can imagine when you're <disfmarker> when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this .",
                "B : Just elder elder people would would buy it ,",
                "D : Well <disfmarker>",
                "B : but <disfmarker>",
                "C : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",
                "A : But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .",
                "D : But <disfmarker>",

                "A : Okay ,",

                "C : when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",
                "A : Yeah .",

                "A : yeah .",
                "C : So maybe that's a possibility ,",

                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : But maybe when we uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : but keep the programme and the volume ,",
                "A : because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Okay .",

                "D : Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition .",
                "D : So then we should implement such a but",

                "A : But we do focus on younger people .",
                "A : We d it",

                "A : it's a board uh decision .",

                "B : So",
                "B : we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .",

                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : So that's that's a big advantage , I think .",
                "A : Okay .",

                "C : There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this .",

                "A : Mm .",

                "C : There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "C : So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself .",
                "A : But <disfmarker> But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?",
                "C : You have to do nothing for it .",
                "D : M <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound> Twelve dollar fifty . <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound> Maybe , maybe not .",
                "A : Because it seems like a very <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "D : And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",

                "C : Yes .",

                "C : It's <disfmarker>",
                "C : Oh ,",
                "C : it's very cheap .",

                "C : It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",

                "C : It's <disfmarker>",
                "A : b uh but there should be an adapter as well .",
                "C : Yes ,",
                "C : but they're they're mass production .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : They're very cheap .",
                "C : So it will cost us p practically nothing .",

                "A : We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um",
                "A : <vocalsound> I would like to hear um <disfmarker> maybe",
                "A : maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about ,",
                "A : yeah ,",
                "A : but that are important .",
                "A : Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data .",
                "A : Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?",
                "D : Um I think we dealt with the most important information .",
                "D : Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to .",
                "D : So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too .",
                "A : Okay .",

                "A : although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh <disfmarker> Profitable . We we <disfmarker> yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",
                "D : Yes . Yeah , profitable .",
                "C : Profitable .",

                "A : Yeah ? Great .",
                "C : so uh basically",
                "C : we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design .",
                "C : So",
                "C : on the outside it looks easy ,",
                "C : but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .",
                "C : So that's one <disfmarker> the <disfmarker>",
                "C : those are the choices we have to make .",
                "C : But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that <disfmarker> these kinds of things .",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience .",
                "C : Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages ,",
                "C : and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques ,",
                "C : which uh I think our customers will like .",
                "C : The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "C : Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not <disfmarker> do not implement these buttons .",
                "C : <vocalsound> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .",
                "C : So that's another <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yeah ,",
                "A : and that was the main issue ,",
                "A : right ?",
                "A : The the board <disfmarker>",
                "C : well ,",
                "C : it wa it w",
                "C : it was an issue ,",
                "C : but we also thought that <disfmarker>",
                "C : we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : And this even uh makes it more cheapy .",
                "B : But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ?",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : The board .",
                "B : The circuit board .",
                "C : The circuit board .",
                "B : The fewer buttons you can use on it .",
                "C : The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .",
                "A : No ,",
                "A : it's th",
                "A : yeah .",
                "B : Yeah , okay .",
                "A : It's the other way around ,",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip .",
                "C : So that's that's another advantage .",
                "A : It shouldn't be a big issue .",
                "B : Well",
                "B : it <disfmarker>",
                "B : then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh <disfmarker> especially for the voice recognition .",
                "C : So <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yes ,",
                "C : because I don't know <disfmarker>",

                "C : Maybe it's more important to make the <disfmarker> make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment ,",
                "C : I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .",
                "C : I don't know if if it's user-friendly .",
                "D : And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .",
                "A : draw draw it on the board .",
                "B : It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what <disfmarker> which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .",
                "B : just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .",
                "A : uh <disfmarker> it's not necessary to to have a full list ,",
                "A : but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .",
                "A : Dual channel watch .",
                "B : I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .",
                "A : And and do we want um the ten digits ?",
                "C : But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .",
                "D : And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .",
                "C : But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull .",
                "A : You c <vocalsound> you can d make them very fancy",
                "C : so you can experiment by <disfmarker> uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .",
                "C : maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .",
                "C : when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .",
                "C : but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .",
                "A : Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits",
                "A : but keep the programme and the volume ,",
                "C : So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .",
                "C : There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .",
                "D : And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .",
                "C : it's very cheap .",
                "C : It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .",
                "A : although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh <disfmarker> Profitable . We we <disfmarker> yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .",
                "C : we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design .",
                "C : but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .",
                "C : But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that <disfmarker> these kinds of things .",
                "C : <vocalsound> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .",
                "B : then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh <disfmarker> especially for the voice recognition .",
                "A : Um <vocalsound> the Interface Designer , um I would like to <disfmarker> the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .",
                "A : User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .",
                "A : It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights .",
                "C : So we drop the voice recognition ?",
                "A : We can decide the next meeting . Yep .",
                "A : I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .",
                "B : if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy",
                "C : they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .",
                "C : Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive ,",
                "A : maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,",
                "B : <gap> just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .",
                "C : But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated",
                "D : 'cause young people uh like new features .",
                "A : We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .",
