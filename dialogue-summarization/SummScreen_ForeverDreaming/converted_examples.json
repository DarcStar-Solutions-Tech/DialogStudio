She also suspects he might have been a double agent for the KGB . Amidst all this confusion , Sydney is made to go undercover in a mental institution in Bucharest to get information from Shepard , a man who has been unconsciously programmed to be a deadly assassin . In the meantime Will Tippin discovers the true identity of Kate Jones ( Eloise Kurtz ) , the woman who claimed to have had an affair with Danny . Francie is relieved to learn that Charlie is not having an affair with another woman but trying to be a singer songwriter and that the woman is the piano player he is rehearsing with . Marshall Flinkman , the chief technician at SD-6 , finds the computer worm planted in the SD-6 mainframe by the CIA and tells Sloane , who congratulates him and tells him it was part of a special security test he s passed . Sloane now has suspicions that someone in SD-6 is a mole and this sets him on his path of finding who it is . Sydney s cover at the asylum is blown when it is revealed that an agent from the K - Directorate is in charge there who also wants to know things from Shepard .",

            "summary": "After helping Shepard escape from the asylum in Bucharest Sydney discovers the shocking connection he has with her past . He was brainwashed by SD-6 and programmed to kill her fianc\u00e9 , among others . Sloane is confronted by Alliance representative Alain Christophe after the computer worm affair blows up , whom suggests that one or more moles may have infiltrated SD-6 . Will Tippin continues to investigate the Eloise Kurtz ( alias Kate Jones ) , who now claims to have been Danny s mistress . He makes an appointment with her , but when he goes to her place it has been emptied and repainted and she is gone . Later , she s found dead in Echo Park . Sydney , in the meantime , understands that Shepard is not really responsible for Danny s murder but he s been used by the SD-6 very much like herself . She lets him go and tells SD-6 that he went totally insane and committed suicide jumping from a bridge near the frontier with Bucharest . Upon her return to Los Angeles , she learns the truth about her father s involvement in her mother s death 20 years earlier . It was his fault because he was fleeing from another car when they had the accident . But Syd also learns for sure that he was not involved with the KGB . He tells her that during the Cold War everybody was suspicious of illegal activities , so he was investigated as a routine process .",
