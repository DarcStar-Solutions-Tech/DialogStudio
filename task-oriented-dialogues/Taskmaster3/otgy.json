Violence/horror is very strong with a shocking hate crime (bullies beat up a gay couple) a man abusing his wife (she hits back) and a character dying via suicide as well as large amounts of blood and terrifying monster attacks. Children are skewered by oversized teeth characters are stabbed with knives and a gun is used in a scary fantasy scene. Language is also heavy with multiple uses of \"f--k\" \"s--t\" and more. Characters kiss and there's some sex-related talk. Adult characters drink socially and smoking (including by a teen) is shown. A brief \"drug trip\" sequence involves a hallucinogenic root.

Ha ha Keep watching when you think the movie has ended for a fun cameo performance that fans will love. Hint: It's someone who was also nominated for an Oscar! Then keep watching until the very very end of the rolling credits for more. Funny references to zombie fans of Shaun of the Dead AND The Walking Dead. It was smart to have it come out close to Halloween. There's a little bit of character development. The tone and feel match the first movie. I didn't realize that the lovely Zoey Deutch is the daughter of actress Lea Thompson and director Howard Deutch. She did a really great job. I first noticed her in Before I Fall a completely different movie from this one!\\n\\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\\n\\nAre people still in to zombies? This sequel should have come out 5-7 years ago. Some of the humor is tired. The plot is pretty simple. I heard Dan Aykroyd was in the movie. I guess I blinked because I missed him. People who haven't seen the first movie will miss the backstories of the characters and inside jokes",

Quote: \"In the first shot of this groundbreaking World War I film two young British soldiers \u2014 lance corporals Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) \u2014 are caught napping in a field. It\u2019s the last time they or we in the audience will be able to catch a breath. For the next two hours director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins will stalk these young men in what seems like one continuous take tagging along as they charge through enemy territory on a mission to save lives. Their orders from General Erinmore (Colin Firth) are crystal clear: They must make their way across booby-trapped corpse-strewn terrain in France to hand-deliver a message to Col. Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) commander of the Second Battalion. It contains orders to call off a planned advance against the German army falsely assumed to be on the ropes. Turns out it\u2019s a trap that could result in the slaughter of more than 1600 British soldiers including Blake\u2019s brother (Richard Madden). With communications down the only hope rests with two boys who can barely shave.\"",
