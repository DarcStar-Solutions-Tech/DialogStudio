Why are you here today?\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.",

He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.\n#Person2#: What about Rubella and Mumps?\n#Person1#: Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.\n#Person2#: OK, great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!\n#Person1#: We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well.
