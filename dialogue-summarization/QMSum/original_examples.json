The current idea was to use an XML script, but it quickly seemed that other options, like a pfile or ATLAS, are more suitable. The reason being that they would make it easier to deal with different linguistic units, like frames and utterances. Eventually, the team was skeptical of using something that would be hard to learn, like ATLAS. Nonetheless, they wanted to explore their options.

Then, the discussion moved onto controlling the size of the bayes-net as it would otherwise be based on too much information. The team ended the meeting by delving into how the method of creating a Bayes-net in different scenarios could itself be abstracted, i.e. narrowing the input and output factors and the intermediate representation."

Alright , so you have nodes . Right ? And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's \" two to the N \" Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify \" three times \" , uh , \" two to the N \" probabilities . Right ? That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be .

Then , {vocalsound} this would be {disfmarker} W The {vocalsound} this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then {disfmarker} this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability , uh {disfmarker} with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say {disfmarker} Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four .

Participants also discussed how the schema would incorporate other information, like choosing movies, and how more complex actions, like that of purchasing goods, could be incorporated into the source-path-goal schema. Finally, the participants concluded that an SPG schema of a different kind, one that can transfer previously acquired information, may be more helpful.

So if you know anyone interested in {disfmarker} in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to {disfmarker} to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast . Um {vocalsound} the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks \" go shopping \" um \" take in uh a batch of art \" um \" visit {disfmarker} do some sightseeing \" blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what Fey has started in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in compiling {disfmarker} compiling here and already {disfmarker} she has already gone to the trouble of {disfmarker} of anchoring it with specific um o {comment} um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . And um . So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if {disfmarker} if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide \" OK , I wanna do that at this place \" , sort of make up their own itinerary a and {disfmarker} and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with {disfmarker} with symbols for the objects . And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that \" ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here \" and \" I wanted to maybe take a picture of that \" and \" maybe um eat here \" and then goes in and solves the task with the system , IE {comment} Fey , and um and we 're gonna try out that {disfmarker} Any questions ?"

Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ? How does the person wanna go there ? Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? Walk a scenic route ? and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . And we are constructing {disfmarker} and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation . And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention {pause} was . And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . So if it can make a good suggestion , \" Hey ! \" you know , \" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , \" cuz he just bought film , or \" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before \" . Or \" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings \" and so forth . These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an {disfmarker} sort of subfield that we have reserved . And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really {disfmarker} at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information .
