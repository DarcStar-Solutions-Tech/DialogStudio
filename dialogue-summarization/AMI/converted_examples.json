                "B : and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand ,",
                "B : so it's just gonna hold it easily .",

                "B : So we began uh working out a concept .",
                "C : Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen .",
                "C : Well , these would be the main buttons ,",
                "C : h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to .",
                "C : But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up .",
                "C : We have the <gap> more advanced menu uh setting right here .",
                "C : We have the sub-menus and stu stuff .",
                "C : We made a top <disfmarker> oh , or a front view .",
                "C : Just so like you wanna uh back view .",
                "C : As you can see , this uh <disfmarker> there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it .",

                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound> This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic .",
                "C : And uh this is for the artistic effect .",
                "C : Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture <gap> later on <gap>",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : you have more b a better idea after that .",
                "C : But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh <disfmarker> with these two .",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "C : And so when you put it on the table , it will just <gap> lay down .",
                "C : It won't <vocalsound> uh roll around or stuff .",
                "C : But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe ,",
                "C : or like these old uh phones .",
                "A : Mm .",
                "C : Y you you may get the idea .",
                "C : So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be .",
                "C : The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers ,",
                "C : like we discussed early on .",
                "C : Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round .",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : the panel just uh of course goes like this .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "A : No , okay .",
                "C : And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh <gap> put some electronics",
                "C : uh that would <disfmarker>",
                "C : you can make a more thinner uh design ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : and that would actually look very nice , yeah .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : And uh , about the colour , what have <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this <disfmarker>",
                "B : maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres .",
                "B : So , you have room here for your battery",
                "B : and maybe even other um electronic chips .",
                "B : S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some <disfmarker> have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh <disfmarker>",

                "C : Oh yeah .",
                "C : Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps .",
                "C : Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior .",
                "C : It uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us .",
                "D : 'S l <disfmarker>",
                "D : it's like an uh Easter egg .",
                "C : Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children .",

                "C : We we want a more adult version .",
                "C : But , this is like a remote control for children .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : It's called a weemote <vocalsound>",

                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "C : So this actually basic the idea .",
                "C : We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Yeah , I can imagine that .",
                "C : <vocalsound> And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey .",
                "C : Those are the technological colours actually ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : so it d",
                "B : It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,",
                "B : so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,",
                "C : Or blue or whatever .",
                "B : but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one .",
                "B : And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible ,",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "B : they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "D : Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .",
                "B : Well ,",
                "B : um I think a cover is necessary ,",
                "B : 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen .",
                "D : Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay .",
                "B : So , there must be some cheap standard cover ,",
                "D : Hmm . Mm .",
                "B : um maybe white or something ,",
                "B : that's could comes with it and you can buy ,",
                "B : so we can make extra money .",
                "A : Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people .",
                "D : Oui okay .",
                "A : Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it ,",
                "A : uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard ,",
                "B : The other way around , you mean .",
                "C : <gap> Oh yeah .",

                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : They want uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they want more luxury stuff ,",

                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah . Yeah , maybe <disfmarker> yeah , perhaps you're right .",
                "C : Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical .",
                "B : Okay , yeah .",
                "D : An another idea .",
                "D : Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : <vocalsound> They'll please the elder users as well .",

                "D : the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .",
                "B : Um I would call uh <disfmarker> choose two ,",
                "B : 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not <gap> .",
                "D : Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .",
                "D : The remote control is made of soft material .",

                "A : Easy to use . One .",
                "D : It's it's not the most easy to use <disfmarker>",
                "D : Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .",
                "D : Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button",
                "B : It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .",
                "A : Okay , two . Yeah , two .",
                "D : The remote control is innovative .",

                "D : The remote control has built-in games ?",

                "A : Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one .",
                "D : The remote control , i it has speech recognition .",

                "A : Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost .",
                "A : Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it .",
                "A : Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So <disfmarker>",
                "B : Kinetic , one .",

                "D : Advanced chip .",

                "C : Then we'll see uh <disfmarker> we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget .",
                "B : Special uh <disfmarker> is the special colour ?",
                "A : <vocalsound> Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : No , this is a standard colour .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yes , this is a special colour . <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound> Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour .",
                "D : Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand .",
                "D : That's another article",
                "C : Well , we're only four Euro over budget .",
                "C : Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .",
                "B : Mm , single-curves .",
                "A : The kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,",
                "A : because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .",
                "D : What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station",
                "B : But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .",
                "C : well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .",
                "B : so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then <disfmarker>",
                "B : No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or <disfmarker>",
                "A : but uh <disfmarker> it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .",
                "B : No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem .",
                "A : So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro .",
                "D : If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more .",
                "B : Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .",
                "D : But <disfmarker> I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price .",
                "C : Yeah , well let's assume it is .",
                "C : But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .",
                "C : No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic .",
                "B : Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So <disfmarker>",
                "A : because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat ,",
                "A : and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise",
                "A : Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign <disfmarker>",
                "A : now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project .",
                "A : was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?",
                "D : But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us .",
                "D : I I didn't think so . That <disfmarker> there was a lot of room for it .",
                "D : and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu",
                "C : Well , I th I think you two , <vocalsound> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project .",
                "C : I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design <disfmarker> we could have more <disfmarker> we had more room for creativity than than you two .",
                "A : Uh how about the leadership ? <vocalsound>",
                "D : I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting .",
                "D : but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more .",
                "D : So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and <disfmarker>",
                "A : I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the",
                "A : and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah , more more consensus .",
                "D : No , it <disfmarker> you did better .",
                "A : Uh , teamwork ?",
                "B : Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .",
                "A : and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .",
                "A : But , really teamwork were you two uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but <disfmarker>",
                "B : D uh just write your name right now .",
                "B : Uh he he knows how it works , yeah .",
                "B : The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh <disfmarker>",
                "D : It's it's not real real use for me .",
                "B : I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow .",
                "A : Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,",
                "B : And the eraser was another problem .",
                "B : M Abo What kind of new ideas ?",
                "A : Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or <disfmarker>",
                "A : I don't know what what I mean .",
                "D : the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six .",
                "D : So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think .",
                "D : all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep .",
                "B : People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and <disfmarker>",
                "A : You had expected it to to be uh more more uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : More user-friendly .",
                "B : And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen .",
                "B : And writing text <disfmarker> uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some <disfmarker>",
                "C : Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent .",
                "D : Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art .",
                "A : But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : So there the the the functionality is there ,",
                "A : but it's not it's not ideal ,",
                "A : it costs a lot of time to uh",
                "B : To use , yeah .",
                "A : Uh , the costs are within the budget .",
                "A : Uh , the project is evaluated .",
                "A : because uh there must be some kind of end report .",

                "A : <vocalsound> here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is <disfmarker>",
                "D : You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .",
                "A : Maybe we can do it uh together .",
                "A : So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .",
                "A : Um , this is about the functional design ,",
                "D : but you can save it u the <disfmarker> under another name .",
                "B : It's a read-only version .",
                "A : about the three functions where <disfmarker> uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control .",
                "A : Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people .",
                "D : No , you have to put <disfmarker> uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second <disfmarker>",
                "D : a volume changing , second .",
                "D : S switch , yes .",
                "A : <vocalsound> then the conceptual design .",
                "B : Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .",
                "A : Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .",
                "C : It's not double .",
                "A : Nay but that <disfmarker> this is what um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Was initial , the plan . The initial plan .",
                "A : And the the added functions like Tetris snake ,",
                "C : the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ?",
                "C : I don't think so , eh ?",

                "D : Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think .",
                "A : well I gonna redesign uh something now .",
                "B : Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .",

                "D : Um we've done some market research .",
                "D : We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .",
                "D : And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends .",
                "D : And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be .",
                "D : Um okay",
                "D : these are some overall findings .",
                "D : Um most important thing is the fancy design .",
                "D : Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .",
                "D : Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design .",
                "D : By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls .",
                "D : Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use .",
                "D : Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal .",

                "D : these are some more group specific findings .",
                "D : Uh the older people prefer dark colours .",
                "D : Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material .",
                "D : And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people .",
                "D : Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have .",
                "D : Um this leads us to some personal preferences .",
                "D : Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room .",
                "D : Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs .",
                "D : Just keep it simple",
                "D : and <disfmarker>",
                "D : Well",
                "D : the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest ,",
                "D : because this would be the <disfmarker> These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control .",
                "D : So this would be very important that we <vocalsound> at least include these features .",
                "D : Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped .",
                "D : So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .",
                "D : This is not really <disfmarker>",
                "D : This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people .",
                "D : So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .",
                "D : So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .",
                "D : Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour .",
                "D : The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money .",
                "D : Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means .",
                "D : That would be all .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : Thank you .",
                "A : Any questions about the the trends ?",

                "B : Um <vocalsound> 'kay um yeah .",
                "B : <gap> uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface .",
                "B : Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons .",
                "B : So uh um uh",
                "B : that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design .",
                "B : So um",
                "B : finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh <disfmarker> I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition .",
                "B : So",
                "B : maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh and uh using a little uh display .",
                "B : So um",
                "B : findings .",
                "B : Um yeah",
                "B : just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions .",
                "B : So uh",
                "B : only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down .",
                "B : Um uh let's see . Um yeah and <disfmarker> Uh",
                "B : <gap> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions",
                "B : uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it .",
                "B : So uh",
                "B : it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles .",
                "B : Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting .",
                "B : Um and yeah",
                "B : overall um user-friendly .",
                "B : So uh",
                "B : using uh large large buttons . Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition .",
                "B : Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal .",
                "B : So uh uh yeah .",
                "B : And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off",
                "B : or <disfmarker> A and",
                "B : uh yeah .",
                "B : Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Let's see . Uh yeah .",
                "B : I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles ,",
                "B : um just one button to keep it uh simple .",
                "B : Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles .",
                "B : Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles .",
                "B : So uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah",
                "B : and w we have to keep uh in general buttons",
                "B : uh so um",
                "B : we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel .",
                "B : Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .",
                "B : And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on .",
                "B : So um",
                "B : made a little uh picture of uh it .",
                "B : Um <disfmarker> See . Um yeah .",
                "B : Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner ,",
                "B : um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place .",
                "B : Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : So um <disfmarker>",
                "B : D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display .",
                "B : Uh um you can put it uh on top .",
                "B : Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of <gap> looks at .",
                "B : So uh um",
                "B : and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the <disfmarker>",
                "B : So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down .",
                "B : Um it's uh quite uh handy place .",
                "B : So um and uh",
                "B : all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it",
                "B : so <disfmarker>",
                "A : Okay .",
                "B : And that's it .",
                "A : Uh thank you . <vocalsound>",
                "C : Okay .",
                "C : About the components design .",
                "C : Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery",
                "C : or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch ,",
                "C : which you just shake and it produces energy .",
                "C : But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .",
                "C : So I don't think it's really an option .",
                "C : Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing .",
                "C : It's really up the the design that we're gonna use .",
                "C : It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions .",
                "C : Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .",
                "C : Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .",
                "C : And the chip-set , um it says simple here ,",
                "C : but it should be advanced ,",
                "C : because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen .",
                "C : And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood ,",
                "C : but it raises the price",
                "C : and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .",
                "C : Form should follow function overall .",
                "C : Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy .",
                "C : But depends on what we want .",
                "C : I think we should disc discuss that .",
                "C : Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer .",
                "C : And the chip-set uh really should be advanced",
                "C : because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control .",
                "C : And that's it .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : Thank you .",
                "A : So",
                "A : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .",
                "A : Mm .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : 'Kay . So",
                "A : these are the points we have to discuss .",
                "A : Um first I think we can talk about the energy source ,",
                "A : since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image .",

                "A : Uh so",
                "A : uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .",
                "C : Yes",
                "C : w",
                "C : there there are four options .",
                "C : We could use the basic normal battery .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Uh a hand dynamo .",
                "C : But I don't think that's <vocalsound> really an option .",
                "A : <vocalsound> Okay <gap> . <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound>",

                "C : But not every room is very light",
                "B : Mm .",
                "C : so it's not a very good option .",
                "A : No .",
                "C : Or the kinetic energy .",
                "A : Yeah . Okay .",
                "D : And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?",
                "C : Well",

                "D : you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .",

                "A : Uh <disfmarker>",

                "A : Uh well",
                "A : I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place .",
                "D : That's true . <vocalsound>",

                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .",
                "B : Yeah . That's true . Yeah .",
                "A : And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .",
                "A : So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Uh .",
                "A : That's safe .",
                "D : I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?",
                "A : Yeah . That's a good point .",
                "C : Mm I don't have any information on pricing .",
                "C : So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "D : 'Cause in our earlier um market research ,",
                "D : if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .",
                "A : Yeah , sure . Go ahead .",
                "D : Um so",
                "D : it was open here .",
                "D : Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .",
                "D : Well",
                "D : you can see here , our target group would not do that .",
                "A : No .",
                "D : So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control",
                "B : Mm .",
                "D : I would greatly advise not to do it .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the",
                "B : <gap>",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : younger people .",
                "C : But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess .",
                "B : 'Kay .",
                "C : It's a bit higher percentage ,",
                "C : but <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um well",
                "D : this is",
                "D : Yeah",
                "D : but this is",
                "D : here the question was , would you prefer it .",
                "D : So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it .",
                "D : And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .",
                "C : Okay .",
                "A : Easier to use ?",
                "A : No ,",
                "A : I think that's a good point .",
                "B : But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?",
                "D : Um well",
                "D : this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "D : So pretty large .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it .",
                "A : Because it's just uh some extra information ,",
                "B : No .",
                "A : and it's easy to ignore as well .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .",
                "A : And um yeah",
                "A : I think the um <disfmarker>",
                "A : Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition .",
                "A : Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly .",
                "A : And I don't think the <disfmarker> I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : So",
                "A : that brings us back to the energy .",
                "A : If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : So",
                "A : in that case we could use kinetic uh energy ,",
                "A : but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good .",
                "A : And much cheaper as well .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : So <disfmarker>",
                "C : And that's the best choice .",
                "A : Okay",
                "A : let me just choose for the battery .",
                "A : That brings us to the chip .",
                "C : Well",
                "C : there isn't any choice there",
                "C : because we're using the the the the display .",
                "A : Just the advanced .",
                "C : So it's gotta be advanced .",
                "A : Okay",
                "D : 'Kay .",
                "A : <gap> , advanced chip .",
                "A : And then we get to the point of the case .",
                "A : Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well .",
                "A : Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?",
                "A : Um as we saw there is not <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yeah",
                "A : wood is a lot more expensive to produce .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive ,",
                "A : which they can show off to their grandkids .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Look I've got a new remote control , and uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Well",
                "B : Uh I dunno .",
                "D : <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour .",
                "D : So it wouldn't actually have to be wood ,",
                "A : Yeah . That's right .",
                "D : if it's just",
                "D : wood-coloured .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "A : But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?",
                "C : Mm I dunno .",
                "A : You don't know ?",
                "C : I'll have to uh research .",
                "A : I think so",
                "A : because <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : Probably .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "A : It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .",
                "B : Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case .",
                "B : So um uh",
                "B : you 'cause",
                "B : uh <disfmarker> Yeah",
                "B : with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : Change the cases . Yeah .",
                "B : So",
                "B : maybe it's possible uh possibility .",
                "B : So um um",
                "B : you have just to make one um standard um remote control ,",
                "B : and um yeah you can sell uh few uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : You can sell the cases .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : I think that's a very good option .",
                "A : Because um then you can advertise as well",
                "A : with the <disfmarker>",
                "A : Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . <vocalsound>",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Because that's a <disfmarker> it's something extra ,",
                "A : it's something other remotes don't have ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : which we can get a great advantage point .",
                "D : Yeah that is true .",
                "A : So",
                "A : and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : We would have to look carefully into the design though .",
                "A : Costs .",
                "D : 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah . So",
                "D : So that would <disfmarker>",
                "A : you suggest we should design two different telephones",
                "A : on which you can apply , yeah <vocalsound> remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .",
                "D : Well",
                "D : I wouldn't design a telephone",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : but <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Well",
                "D : no",
                "D : I think w we should just , we should then just design one um",
                "A : Remote .",
                "D : one remote ,",
                "D : but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "A : Okay .",
                "D : So ,",
                "D : but that shouldn't be too much of a problem .",
                "A : So",
                "A : everybody's okay with the changing covers ?",
                "C : Yes .",
                "A : I think that's a good uh good option .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Changing case covers .",
                "D : Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved .",
                "C : Yes .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : Could you explain that a little more ?",
                "C : Well",
                "C : the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .",
                "D : And what would single curved and double curved mean ?",
                "C : Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .",
                "C : So",
                "C : it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "C : It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .",
                "D : So",
                "D : we can pretty much just do whatever we want .",
                "C : Pick one you like ,",
                "C : yes .",
                "A : Mm . Okay .",
                "D : 'Kay .",
                "D : That's good .",
                "A : Uh but the form has to be um <disfmarker> It has to <disfmarker>",
                "A : It's has to be possible to stand up ?",
                "A : Or just only to lie down ?",
                "D : No",
                "D : just to lie down .",
                "B : <gap> okay .",
                "A : And the the cover of the the docking station is also",
                "D : We'll go for that .",
                "A : on top of the television then ? Or not ?",
                "D : Well",
                "D : or besides it .",
                "A : And you can just yeah then click it in .",
                "A : That's okay .",
                "A : Um so",
                "A : the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ?",
                "A : Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",

                "D : Um we've done some market research .",
                "D : We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .",
                "D : And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends .",

                "D : Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material .",
                "D : And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people .",

                "D : So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .",
                "D : This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people .",
                "D : So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .",
                "D : Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour .",

                "B : <gap> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions",
                "B : it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles .",

                "B : using uh large large buttons . Um <disfmarker>",

                "B : Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal .",

                "B : Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner ,",
                "B : D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display .",
                "B : Uh um you can put it uh on top .",
                "B : and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the <disfmarker>",
                "C : About the components design .",
                "C : Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery",
                "C : or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch ,",
                "C : But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .",
                "C : So I don't think it's really an option .",
                "C : Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing .",
                "C : It's really up the the design that we're gonna use .",
                "C : Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .",
                "C : Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .",
                "C : And the chip-set , um it says simple here ,",
                "C : but it should be advanced ,",
                "C : because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen .",
                "C : And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood ,",
                "C : but it raises the price",
                "C : and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .",
                "C : Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy .",
                "C : But depends on what we want .",
                "C : Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer .",
                "A : that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .",
                "A : Um first I think we can talk about the energy source ,",
                "A : uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .",
                "C : We could use the basic normal battery .",
                "C : Uh a hand dynamo .",
                "C : there there are four options .",
                "C : But I don't think that's <vocalsound> really an option .",
                "C : Uh solar cells .",
                "C : But not every room is very light",
                "C : Or the kinetic energy .",
                "D : And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?",
                "C : y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .",
                "D : personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .",
                "D : And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .",
                "D : And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um",
                "D : get great popularity for our product .",
                "D : you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .",
                "B : Uh it's uh just a small display",
                "B : so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more .",
                "A : I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place .",
                "A : And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .",
                "A : So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .",
                "A : And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .",
                "A : But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .",
                "A : So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .",
                "A : And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .",
                "D : I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?",
                "C : Mm I don't have any information on pricing .",
                "D : Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .",
                "D : you can see here , our target group would not do that .",
                "D : I would greatly advise not to do it .",
                "D : So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control",
                "C : But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess .",
                "C : It's a bit higher percentage ,",
                "D : here the question was , would you prefer it .",
                "D : And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .",
                "D : And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .",
                "A : I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it .",
                "A : Because it's just uh some extra information ,",
                "A : Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition .",
                "A : If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um <disfmarker>",
                "A : in that case we could use kinetic uh energy ,",
                "A : but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good .",
                "A : And much cheaper as well .",
                "C : And that's the best choice .",
                "A : let me just choose for the battery .",
                "A : That brings us to the chip .",
                "C : there isn't any choice there",
                "C : because we're using the the the the display .",
                "C : So it's gotta be advanced .",
                "A : And then we get to the point of the case .",
                "A : Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?",
                "A : wood is a lot more expensive to produce .",
                "A : Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive ,",
                "D : <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour .",
                "A : But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?",
                "C : I'll have to uh research .",
                "A : It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .",
                "B : with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it .",
                "B : Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case .",
                "B : you have just to make one um standard um remote control ,",
                "A : I think that's a very good option .",
                "A : You can sell the cases .",
                "A : and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .",
                "D : We would have to look carefully into the design though .",
                "A : Costs .",
                "D : I think w we should just , we should then just design one um",
                "D : one remote ,",
                "D : but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .",
                "A : everybody's okay with the changing covers ?",
                "A : I think that's a good uh good option .",
                "D : Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved .",
                "C : the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .",
                "D : And what would single curved and double curved mean ?",
                "C : Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know .",
                "A : It's has to be possible to stand up ?",
                "A : Or just only to lie down ?",
                "D : just to lie down .",
                "A : the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ?",
                "B : Uh we can just use the regular form of it ,",
                "D : Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side ,",
                "D : so you could , so your thumb would be easily <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .",

                "B : Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh <vocalsound> uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ?",
                "D : but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .",

                "A : Yes .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Well , you know um ,",
                "C : I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive <disfmarker> that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own .",
                "C : So it would <disfmarker> really would need to um <disfmarker> <vocalsound>",
                "C : something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well ,",

                "A : Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing ,",
                "A : so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",

                "A : Yes I think uh that would be good ,",
                "A : because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan ,",
                "A : because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money ,",
                "A : okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay ,",
                "A : then we can have the further discussion again .",

                "A : and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?",
                "D : Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas ,",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Hmm .",
                "D : uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .",

                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh <disfmarker> the competition ,",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : uh th I agree it has to be something <disfmarker> it has to be something new ,",
                "D : it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this .",
                "D : Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design ,",
                "D : and then it's gotta be simple to use .",
                "A : Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay ,",
                "A : because you know what she is going to do it , okay ,",
                "A : and you know how to sell it . Okay ,",
                "A : because uh she is doing the design ,",
                "A : but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : so because you need to sell <disfmarker> and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the <disfmarker> your sales plan , okay ,",
                "D : Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for ,",
                "A : th",
                "A : Th That <disfmarker> that's",
                "D : that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yes , that's <disfmarker> you have to decide , okay ,",
                "A : so the best thing is you <disfmarker> uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost ,",
                "A : and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay .",
                "A : Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .",
                "A : Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually .",
                "A : Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Very good .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Jesus .",
                "B : Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey .",
                "B : A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things .",
                "B : And what we got was , we found that <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market .",
                "B : Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .",
                "B : They are not so good looking .",
                "B : So , we have to put stress on this ,",
                "B : uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .",
                "B : And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales .",
                "B : Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also .",
                "B : So even if the available market goes for the available <disfmarker>",
                "B : uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros ,",
                "B : which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls .",
                "C : Excellent .",
                "B : Then <disfmarker>",
                "B : <gap> And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls ,",
                "B : but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .",
                "B : Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons ,",
                "B : so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it .",
                "B : Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things .",
                "B : So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .",
                "B : So we have to take care of this fact also .",
                "B : Then .",
                "B : Uh it was function I want to go to .",
                "C : Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape .",

                "C : Okay .",
                "B : uh these are in your shared documents , you can see ,",
                "C : Okay .",
                "B : like <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh , sorry .",
                "D : So , sorry <disfmarker>",
                "D : I was just gonna say ,",
                "D : what was the question for this ?",
                "D : Or is <disfmarker> are you coming on to that ?",
                "B : Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "D : So these percentages are are what ?",
                "B : Yeah , these are different age group persons",
                "B : like uh",
                "B : sorry ,",
                "B : I can open it in another way .",
                "C : Okay . Speech recognition .",
                "B : Uh , yes .",
                "B : If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : So we can emphasise on this point also like ,",
                "B : because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,",
                "D : Hmm .",
                "B : and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group .",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "B : So we should look <disfmarker>",
                "C : We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . <gap>",
                "B : Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes . <vocalsound>",
                "C : Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of .",
                "D : Mm , mm .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : So , and <disfmarker>",
                "C : <gap>",
                "B : <gap>",
                "B : <vocalsound> And then <disfmarker>",
                "C : Fifteen to twe",
                "B : Yes . I think so .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .",
                "B : They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control .",
                "B : So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls",
                "B : and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people <disfmarker> consumers could easily learn .",
                "B : They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales .",
                "B : So um this is all about",
                "C : Okay . <vocalsound>",

                "D : they've",
                "D : I mean this one's got loads of buttons ,",
                "D : it's hard to tell from here what they actually do ,",
                "C : <gap> <vocalsound>",
                "D : and they don't look very exciting at all .",
                "D : Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use ,",
                "D : it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : um , but there you go , that's what we're up against ,",
                "D : and I think we can do much better than that .",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : And um I thought not too edgy and like a box ,",

                "C : Organic <vocalsound> .",
                "D : or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think .",
                "D : <vocalsound> Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw ,",

                "D : because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah it's like a , yeah .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : It's <gap> . <vocalsound>",

                "D : but um anyway um so hand-held and portable",
                "D : and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that ,",

                "D : so maybe we forget about that .",
                "C : And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure .",
                "D : And so the last thing I thought",
                "D : w which I quickly mentioned in the other one",
                "D : was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Exactly . Yeah .",
                "D : um which <vocalsound> does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : Easy finder with the a whistle function or something ,",
                "C : Okay .",
                "D : or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : And I think that , yep , that's it .",
                "C : That's cool .",
                "A : So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling ,",

                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?",

                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : is that a function we want in the remote ?",
                "D : Um , I haven't been able to <disfmarker>",
                "C : Um , do you have trouble whistling ?",
                "A : I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Really ?",
                "C : Ooh . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah",
                "A : it just",
                "A : <disfmarker> I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?",
                "D : Mm-hmm , yeah",
                "C : Yeah , I suppose that's true .",
                "D : or some sort of voice <disfmarker>",
                "C : Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the",
                "C : you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <gap> . <vocalsound>",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : <vocalsound> That's costly though .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Hmm .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Sounds good .",
                "A : uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?",
                "D : Yeah , something .",
                "A : <vocalsound> Okay .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Well , uh let me set this up .",
                "A : So I plug it in , press F_ five ?",
                "A : Function F_ five ?",
                "C : Function F_ eight for the um the uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : Or function F_ eight ?",
                "A : Okay .",
                "D : Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .",
                "A : Okay . I think it's <vocalsound> uh just to lock it in .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : It's got it .",
                "D : Okay .",

                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Um .",
                "A : <vocalsound> So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Alright .",
                "A : um so it's good you went first ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .",
                "C : Let's remember that .",
                "A : Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products ,",
                "A : and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour .",
                "A : Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used ,",
                "A : and uh <vocalsound>",
                "A : he mentioned that they're not fun to use .",
                "A : And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,",
                "C : <gap>",
                "A : there could be a little microphone on it ,",
                "A : and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Oh yeah , yeah , that's true .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Well maybe you could have a",
                "A : um hmm <vocalsound>",
                "A : tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes .",
                "A : Um .",
                "C : Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um ,",
                "A : and then as for the user interface it should be trendy ,",
                "A : um <vocalsound> and not computery ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : So I took these all into consideration",
                "A : and also I have some limitations from the boss .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Right um ,",
                "A : and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : And so I did a little research",
                "A : and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before ,",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains <disfmarker>",
                "C : Ah is that what that is ? <vocalsound>",
                "A : Or uh or a high speed train .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : <vocalsound> Right",
                "A : and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Well that's cool .",
                "C : If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .",
                "A : Right . So ,",
                "D : Yeah sure .",
                "A : I figured , just put 'em all together .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Hmm .",
                "A : as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "A : and and it's a <disfmarker> you know , for the the cowboy in all of us <gap>",
                "A : <disfmarker> I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but <disfmarker>",
                "C : Right okay . <vocalsound>",
                "D : Well I like that design . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a <disfmarker>",
                "C : Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ?",
                "A : Right .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : So I think I I missed the budget thing ,",
                "A : it was fifty million Euros ?",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah .",
                "A : And we gotta sell twenty five of them ?",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "A : Right . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound>",
                "D : not a problem .",
                "B : Fifty million was uh prof",
                "C : Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g <vocalsound>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "B : As a profit .",
                "A : Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers .",
                "C : gotta make profit ,",
                "C : so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Okay .",
                "A : Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing ,",
                "A : cheap plastic uh , you know ,",
                "A : um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <vocalsound>",
                "C : Okay .",
                "A : um , we don't wanna have it <disfmarker>",
                "C : Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?",
                "C : Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ?",
                "A : Uh .",
                "D : Or a little base station or something , <gap> .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah , yeah , we could do that too .",
                "A : Um , I hadn't thought of that .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : <vocalsound> That might cost more though ,",
                "D : 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's <disfmarker> that's cheaper to just provide batteries .",
                "C : Yeah , yeah .",
                "A : Right .",
                "C : I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it ,",
                "D : A battery in it , kinda .",
                "C : so I don't think it'd up up the price that much .",
                "A : Right ,",
                "D : Okay .",
                "A : so so <vocalsound>",
                "A : the unirs the user interface",
                "D : <vocalsound> Okay .",
                "A : uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons ,",
                "A : but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Okay . <vocalsound>",
                "A : behind our product .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .",
                "C : Okay . <vocalsound>",

                "A : you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that .",
                "A : <vocalsound> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it",
                "A : and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so <disfmarker>",
                "A : uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory ,",
                "A : uh non volatile memory ,",
                "A : just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .",
                "D : Mm .",

                "A : Oh okay .",
                "A : And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort",

                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .",
                "C : Right .",
                "D : Mm 'kay .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",

                "C : so didn't manage to forward it on to you ,",
                "C : it is <disfmarker>",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Um , <vocalsound> dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind .",
                "C : Um it's only for the television ,",
                "C : which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television ,",
                "D : Okay .",
                "C : and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .",

                "D : Mm-hmm .",

                "C : flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um",

                "D : Well <disfmarker>",
                "C : So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a <disfmarker>",
                "D : Mm .",
                "C : or it looks like we're just cutting on the um <disfmarker>",
                "D : On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .",
                "C : I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .",
                "D : Mm-hmm , okay .",
                "D : Okay , cool .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that ,",
                "C : or maybe they'll send",
                "B : About cost .",
                "C : some information about that ,",
                "C : about um what people ,",
                "C : whether people would require um teletext in a remote <disfmarker> teletext option in a remote control .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : <gap> <vocalsound> Okay um <gap> .",
                "C : So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the <disfmarker> a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick .",
                "A : Yeah yeah .",
                "C : Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display .",
                "C : However that does sound a bit like the",
                "C : more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "C : said people didn't like .",
                "D : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .",
                "C : Although I guess if there's a sort of <disfmarker>",
                "C : If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons ,",
                "C : and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have",
                "C : um <vocalsound> it goes to a different selection of buttons ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : so it sorta keeps it simple .",
                "D : Okay .",
                "C : Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?",
                "D : Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh .",
                "D : Glow in the dark material I was thinking .",
                "C : Okay .",
                "C : So <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think .",
                "B : I <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh may I say something about <gap> ?",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market",
                "B : because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room .",
                "B : But <disfmarker>",
                "D : Often lost s was that ,",
                "C : Lost , yeah .",
                "B : yeah are lost",
                "D : yeah .",
                "B : and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark .",
                "B : Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control ,",
                "C : That's cool .",
                "D : Mm-hmm ,",
                "D : mm-hmm .",
                "C : That's cool .",
                "B : and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales ,",
                "B : so we should take it into consideration also .",
                "C : Okay , cool .",
                "C : Um",
                "A : Well hmm .",
                "C : speech recognition I take it <disfmarker>",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : Oh it's <disfmarker>",
                "C : I don't , I've <disfmarker>",
                "C : I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .",
                "A : They're act there",
                "A : there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a <disfmarker> some basic speech recognition on it .",
                "A : You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel .",
                "C : Really ?",
                "A : Yeah ,",
                "A : it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem .",
                "D : Mm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one <gap> .",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .",
                "D : <gap>",
                "A : Right , right ,",
                "A : and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something ,",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Mm .",
                "D : 'Kay .",
                "A : but if you can work around that that noise problem <disfmarker>",
                "C : Uh-huh .",
                "D : Well what about <disfmarker>",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "D : this might get a bit too expensive actually ,",
                "D : but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal",
                "D : you know like the ones that we can't hear or <vocalsound> something",
                "C : Ah , that's a good idea .",
                "A : <gap>",
                "D : um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .",
                "A : Right .",
                "C : So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . <vocalsound>",
                "D : If you find if y",
                "A : Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "A : What you could do then would be you have uh <vocalsound> a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker ,",
                "A : or not a remo I'm sorry ,",
                "A : a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote ,",
                "A : 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s .",
                "D : Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah .",
                "A : But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker",
                "C : That we should just stick on ,",
                "C : yeah .",
                "D : That comes with our remote control .",
                "A : which <disfmarker>",
                "A : Right ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap .",
                "A : Right , right .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Right , right .",
                "A : Um . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Yeah that's certainly possible",
                "A : then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again .",
                "A : If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it .",
                "A : You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for ,",
                "A : you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off ,",
                "A : you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range .",
                "C : Uh-huh .",
                "A : And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .",
                "D : That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah .",
                "A : Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . <vocalsound>",
                "C : <vocalsound> It might do us out of a job .",
                "D : Yeah , okay .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Okay .",
                "C : <vocalsound> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing .",
                "C : Um so I think rather than <disfmarker>",
                "C : and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that ,",
                "D : Mm .",
                "A : Hmm .",
                "D : And the expense .",
                "C : so I th",
                "C : yeah and expense and the time .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : So I think if we're going to go <disfmarker>",
                "C : well I mean like the thing about the <disfmarker> there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of",
                "C : uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .",
                "D : Mm .",
                "C : Um , but I guess not",
                "C : I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem .",
                "C : Um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh <vocalsound>",
                "C : and how are you about the glow in the dark material ?",
                "C : Is that <disfmarker>",
                "A : Um .",
                "D : Maybe not even all of it",
                "D : 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important",
                "D : so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .",
                "A : Mm .",
                "C : Contrast contra well .",
                "A : Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know ,",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more .",
                "C : Yeah , okay .",
                "C : So if it's dow it's d uh",
                "C : yeah .",
                "C : Or if it's down under the couch cushions",
                "A : Right .",
                "C : um which is where I usually find mine .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Right .",
                "C : Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker>",
                "C : Okay , well we can use <disfmarker>",
                "C : we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : 'cause what I thought , main <disfmarker>",
                "C : um if we're gonna have to <disfmarker>",
                "C : if we're gonna have the logo on as well ,",
                "C : bright yellow logo in our our um",
                "C : slogan .",
                "D : Slogan , yeah .",
                "C : Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway ,",
                "C : and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .",
                "D : Right .",
                "D : Mm-hmm .",
                "D : 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um <vocalsound> uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .",
                "D : That was more of a a gimmick .",
                "C : Do you think ?",
                "D : Mm .",
                "C : Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then .",
                "D : Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah .",
                "C : Okay .",
                "C : Um , okay so scratch that .",
                "C : Uh so we've got",
                "C : do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the <disfmarker> is that far too expensive ?",
                "A : <vocalsound> Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now ,",
                "A : I I think <disfmarker>",
                "C : <vocalsound> Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .",

                "C : now , it was function F_ eight .",
                "B : <vocalsound> f oh sorry F_ eight .",
                "C : <gap> and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .",
                "B : Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product ,",
                "B : Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey .",
                "B : Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .",
                "B : uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .",
                "B : Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also .",
                "B : but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .",
                "B : Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons ,",
                "C : Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape .",
                "B : If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .",
                "B : because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,",
                "B : They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control .",
                "D : Yeah . No signal .",
                "B : Computer adjusting , yeah .",
                "C : Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing .",
                "D : uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user",
                "D : I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics ,",
                "D : the basic <disfmarker> that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .",
                "D : but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones .",
                "D : These are two leading um remote controls at the moment .",
                "D : I mean this one's got loads of buttons ,",
                "D : Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use ,",
                "D : it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff ,",
                "D : Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um",
                "D : And um I thought not too edgy and like a box ,",
                "D : so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .",
                "D : was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark",
                "D : Easy finder with the a whistle function or something ,",
                "D : or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .",
                "A : and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?",
                "A : is that a function we want in the remote ?",
                "C : you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <gap> . <vocalsound>",
                "A : Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know ,",
                "A : uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?",
                "D : Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .",
                "A : So I plug it in , press F_ five ?",
                "A : and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .",
                "A : And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,",
                "A : there could be a little microphone on it ,",
                "A : and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .",
                "C : But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .",
                "A : and then as for the user interface it should be trendy ,",
                "A : right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .",
                "A : So I think I I missed the budget thing ,",
                "A : it was fifty million Euros ?",
                "C : so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .",
                "A : Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing ,",
                "A : An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <vocalsound>",
                "A : cheap plastic uh , you know ,",
                "C : Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?",
                "A : Yeah , yeah , we could do that too .",
                "D : Or a little base station or something , <gap> .",
                "A : uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons ,",
                "A : but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power",
                "A : Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .",
                "A : Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .",
                "A : uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory ,",
                "A : just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .",
                "A : And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort",
                "A : and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .",
                "C : Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting ,",
                "C : We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .",
                "C : Um it's only for the television ,",
                "C : and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .",
                "C : Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .",
                "C : And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <disfmarker>",
                "C : Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .",
                "C : speech recognition potentially ,",
                "C : flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um",
                "C : we also want to limit the number of buttons",
                "C : Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display .",
                "C : Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?",
                "B : But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,",
                "C : I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .",
                "D : but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal",
                "D : um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .",
                "A : You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for ,",
                "A : you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range .",
                "C : <vocalsound> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing .",
                "C : we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,",
                "C : and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .",
                "A : there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged .",
                "C : So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that ,",
                "C : Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a",
                "A : Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .",
                "C : so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ?",
                "C : Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .",
                "B : Glow in dark .",
                "D : if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .",
                "C : And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <vocalsound>",
                "C : getting strings of um information ,",
                "C : I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular ,",
                "D : <vocalsound> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material ,",
                "D : Um , a bit more <vocalsound> durable and that can also be ergonomic",
                "B : So <vocalsound> we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .",
                "C : And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the <disfmarker>",
                "C : We put the fashion in electronics",
                "C : Okay , that felt a bit more like a <disfmarker> something with order and and reason to it than the last one .",
                "C : Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire ."

                "D : this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button",

                "B : Oh no wait we <disfmarker>",
                "B : ho how many colours have we got there ?",
                "A : For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .",
                "B : Just one colour , okay .",
                "A : 'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .",

                "B : so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?",
                "A : Yes .",
                "A : One and the L_C_ display .",
                "B : Okay",
                "B : and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?",
                "A : How many <disfmarker>",
                "D : Um we have um got some push buttons as well .",
                "C : Or even clear .",
                "A : We've got push buttons as well .",

                "D : 'Kay .",
                "B : so push button and integrated scroll wheel push",
                "B : okay .",
                "D : So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .",
                "B : Uh-huh .",
                "D : I'm not sure if that counts but <disfmarker>",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : Okay um",
                "A : and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .",
                "B : Four .",
                "D : You can see we're we're all very far beyond the <disfmarker>",
                "B : So w why are we arriving at the number four ?",
                "B : Where does the number four come from ?",
                "A : 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .",
                "B : Okay right ,",
                "B : so we're writing down four .",
                "A : So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .",
                "B : <vocalsound> Okay .",
                "B : How about these ?",
                "B : Are we wanting them in <disfmarker>",
                "A : No .",
                "B : no",
                "B : they're just <disfmarker>",
                "B : is everything gonna be plastic ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "B : So we're w w quite far over .",
                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Now we're gonna <disfmarker>",
                "B : something's gonna have to go .",
                "B : Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>",
                "C : Uh how mm-hmm <disfmarker>",
                "C : how are we going to achieve this high-end product if <disfmarker>",
                "B : Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro ,",
                "C : We only have very sparse <disfmarker>",
                "B : so",
                "B : let me see ,",
                "B : what are we <disfmarker>",
                "C : Two point three ?",
                "B : I mean <disfmarker>",
                "C : Four point three",
                "C : no ?",
                "B : oh yes",
                "B : sorry ,",
                "B : four point three .",
                "B : My maths is all out .",
                "D : Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : And then where is the <disfmarker>",
                "A : How much would that save us ?",
                "B : How much would that save us ?",
                "A : That will only save you one .",
                "D : That is one .",
                "B : One .",
                "A : The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",
                "A : um because when you",
                "A : do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing",
                "D : That's fair enough , yeah .",
                "A : so we may not need to <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Okay so <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : which I think is a technically doable thing so <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : So w what's our reviewed suggestion ?",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : Um take away the L_C_ display ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "A : And the advanced chip goes away as well .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : To be replaced with a",
                "A : Regular chip .",
                "B : regular chip .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "A : So what that means is that um <disfmarker>",
                "B : <vocalsound> And so we've got point three to get rid of .",
                "B : Um and we ha",
                "B : where are the four <disfmarker> the four push buttons are where exactly now ?",
                "A : The twelve buttons that you see there <vocalsound> .",
                "B : Twelve buttons .",
                "D : That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Functionally you're gonna have to intercept <disfmarker>",
                "A : So four is a good estimate for <disfmarker>",
                "B : Do you think ?",
                "A : Yeah ,",
                "A : so you can't actually cut <vocalsound> <disfmarker>",
                "A : It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .",
                "B : Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,",
                "B : how can it be something in between ?",
                "A : It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "B : Mm .",

                "B : Okay",
                "B : well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .",
                "A : We just report that it has to be over budget <vocalsound> ,",
                "B : Mm .",
                "C : <vocalsound>",
                "A : or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .",
                "B : No can do .",
                "C : Yeah",
                "C : we could just go with um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah w",
                "A : Normal coloured buttons .",
                "B : Well do you want colour differentiation here ?",
                "A : No that's not the button we're talking about .",

                "C : because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that <disfmarker>",

                "A : You you still have your blue fingers .",
                "C : so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a <disfmarker>",

                "D : Is it ?",

                "D : <vocalsound>",
                "C : The idea is that I've set up <disfmarker>",
                "C : I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,",
                "C : and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,",
                "C : and uh so we can review that .",
                "C : Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary",
                "C : because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but <disfmarker>",
                "C : Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?",

                "C : Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board ,",
                "C : so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um <disfmarker> sort of review where we stand with it .",
                "C : Okay , so um <disfmarker>",
                "C : So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,",
                "C : uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,",

                "B : Mm 'kay .",
                "C : So these i these i th are the <disfmarker>",
                "C : and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,",
                "C : so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so",
                "C : we just come to an agreement .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Okay ?",
                "C : So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .",

                "B : isn't it ?",
                "B : I mean I'd give that nearly a one .",

                "C : We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .",
                "D : Yeah I think it's about five .",
                "C : Five ?",

                "C : Was that an option ?",
                "D : I think I'd probably increase the cost .",
                "A : I think it'll be cost prohibitive ,",

                "B : Uh yeah .",
                "C : I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about",

                "C : Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .",
                "B : It's pretty good .",

                "C : I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .",
                "B : Uh-huh .",
                "C : It's not something I need to p push through ,",
                "C : but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant ,",

                "C : uh okay I'll just go through your system then .",
                "C : The the room uh is fairly institutional ,",

                "B : Uh-huh .",

                "B : Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?",
                "C : d debating <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah , yeah",
                "C : but that's just",
                "C : the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room ,",
                "C : it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .",
                "B : But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .",
                "B : I think it means like you know <disfmarker>",

                "C : Sorry .",
                "B : I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so <disfmarker>",

                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah",
                "C : I th okay on th um yeah dif",
                "C : answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity",
                "C : because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme ,",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours .",

                "C : So what do we do .",
                "C : We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker>",
                "A : You feel like you're caged within whatever y",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Yeah within the constraints",
                "A : It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .",
                "C : the <disfmarker>",
                "B : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah .",
                "A : The constraints do come in very fast .",
                "B : Okay uh do you know what ,",
                "C : So <disfmarker>",
                "B : actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think .",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig .",
                "D : Um I agree with his point",
                "D : it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Yep .",
                "A : I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to <disfmarker> allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .",
                "C : Mm-hmm ,",
                "B : Mm .",

                "C : <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah .",
                "A : And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah , sure .",
                "A : I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .",
                "C : New creativity .",
                "A : I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .",
                "C : Yep .",
                "C : Right .",
                "B : So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or <disfmarker>",
                "A : Not not so much an atmosphere ,",
                "A : the atmosphere is very relaxed ,",
                "A : but the the gear",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : but actual environment ?",

                "A : you know that creates boundaries to that um",
                "C : Mm .",
                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker>",

                "B : Okay .",
                "B : Very good .",
                "B : Um what about leadership ?",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "B : I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something .",
                "B : I don't really know .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : Yeah , well well I mean",
                "C : my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement <disfmarker>",
                "B : From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?",
                "C : Yeah from <disfmarker>",
                "C : and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .",
                "B : Okay .",
                "C : Um yeah I think I think it's",
                "A : <vocalsound> Excuse me .",
                "C : I think it's good .",
                "C : I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation ,",
                "C : but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and",
                "B : Mm-hmm .",
                "C : you know , innovative thought with .",
                "A : <vocalsound>",
                "C : In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within .",
                "C : And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker>",

                "B : okay .",
                "C : But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .",

                "B : So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker>",

                "A : I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .",

                "A : I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .",

                "C : I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork",
                "C : because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation",

                "C : but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept ,",
                "C : and we sit here together and do it ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : well that's what teamwork is .",
                "C : To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .",

                "C : I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,",
                "C : but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been ,",
                "C : maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .",
                "B : Mm .",
                "C : Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that .",
                "C : I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype",
                "C : and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : And point at ?",

                "C : and and",
                "C : and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,",
                "C : we're just <disfmarker>",
                "C : we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .",
                "C : It wasn't until we had this here , you know ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book .",
                "B : Ah .",
                "C : But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um <disfmarker>",
                "B : So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?",
                "C : Think could be , yeah .",
                "A : I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah , yeah .",
                "A : and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .",

                "C : Mm-hmm .",

                "C : Mm-hmm .",
                "A : or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place ,",

                "B : Okay .",
                "A : you know in the centre of the <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare ,",
                "C : whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it ,",
                "B : Alright .",
                "C : um 'ca you know ,",
                "C : just 'cause that's sorta how we <disfmarker> what we were set up to to use while we had our time .",
                "B : Okay uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings <vocalsound> .",

                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally ,",

                "C : Hmm .",

                "B : um if we need to rethink anything at all .",
                "B : for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?",
                "B : Do we have kinetic as well ?",
                "A : No .",
                "B : And that's because of cost restraints is it ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "A : We need an advanced chip I think , yep .",
                "B : So we want double-curved ?",
                "A : I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .",
                "B : um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?",
                "A : For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .",
                "A : We've got push buttons as well .",
                "B : So we're w w quite far over .",
                "A : Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .",
                "B : something's gonna have to go .",
                "B : Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>",
                "A : The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,",
                "A : so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,",
                "A : It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .",
                "A : or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .",
                "B : No can do .",
                "A : Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,",
                "B : And now we're under budget .",
                "D : sort of <vocalsound> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .",
                "B : width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?",
                "B : How how tall do you envisage it being ?",
                "B : About two centimetres , okay .",
                "C : Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .",
                "B : Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .",
                "C : but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,",
                "A : I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,",
                "A : so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .",
                "C : What about button shape ?",
                "C : Square buttons ?",
                "A : Yeah",
                "A : Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .",
                "B : discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points ,",
                "C : I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,",
                "C : and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,",
                "C : So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,",
                "C : uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,",
                "C : and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,",
                "C : So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .",
                "A : I rate that pretty highly .",
                "C : Okay let's go with five then .",
                "C : Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .",
                "C : Let's go with two point five then .",
                "C : high tech innovation .",
                "C : so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,",
                "C : but jog-dial",
                "B : Yeah about three , okay .",
                "C : Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .",
                "A : the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,",
                "A : Okay , the blue the blue colours and <disfmarker> don't re don't actually represent the colour ,",
                "C : so we'll go two .",
                "C : and um design is simple to use , simple in features .",
                "B : I mean I'd give that nearly a one .",
                "C : Um , <vocalsound> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?",
                "C : We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .",
                "D : Yeah I think it's about five .",
                "C : logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?",
                "C : And um it's within budget , yep .",
                "C : out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .",
                "C : We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .",
                "C : So it's pretty good .",
                "C : I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .",
                "C : It's not something I need to p push through ,",
                "C : but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker>",
                "B : uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .",
                "B : Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <vocalsound>",
                "B : Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?",
                "C : Yeah , yeah",
                "C : it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .",
                "B : But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .",
                "C : answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity",
                "C : We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,",
                "C : so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker>",
                "A : The constraints do come in very fast .",
                "D : it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .",
                "A : I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,",
                "A : and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker>",
                "A : it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .",
                "A : and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker>",
                "C : In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within .",
                "C : And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker>",
                "C : But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .",
                "A : I think the interactions are very structured .",
                "B : So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .",
                "A : I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,",
                "D : Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .",
                "B : uh what about teamwork ?",
                "D : If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .",
                "A : I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .",
                "C : I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork",
                "C : because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation",
                "C : I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,",
                "C : maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .",
                "C : I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype",
                "C : and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss",
                "C : and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,",
                "C : we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .",
                "A : I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,",
                "A : and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .",
                "A : And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally ,",
                "B : What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?",
                "D : Oh they're a bit clunky .",
                "A : Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well ,",
                "A : But I think the pen is v is very intuitive ,",
                "A : So I think the pen's good .",
                "C : And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .",
                "C : We only actually needed one computer .",
                "A : And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,",
                "C : , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .",
                "C : well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .",
                "B : I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on",
                "B : I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room ,",
                "B : and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c",
                "A : And we have Ninja Homer .",
                "B : Well apparently now I write the final report .",
                "B : I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber ,",
                "A : Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .",
                "A : It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .",
                "A : Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .",
                "A : It becomes tangible ."
