It's a Standard car also. Would you like a Honda Civic? <USER> Maybe. What would that cost? <SYSTEM> It'd cost about $92 in total. <USER> Okay. Is there anything else available? I'd like it in Philadelphia now? <SYSTEM> There's about 6 six cars in Philadelphia you may like. The first one is a nice Standard car pickup in Intercity Terminal starting on March 6th. It's a Hyundai Elantra. <USER> That sounds just fine. <SYSTEM> Should I book it for you? <USER> Yes, please go ahead. <SYSTEM> Okay. I want to make sure.

Would you like a Ford Fusion? <USER> Sure, but what does it cost? <SYSTEM> It would cost $116 to book it. <USER> Do you have anything else? <SYSTEM> There is another car available at King Street Station on March 6th. It's a Standard car also. Would you like a Honda Civic? <USER> Maybe. What would that cost? <SYSTEM> It'd cost about $92 in total. <USER> Okay. Is there anything else available? I'd like it in Philadelphia now? <SYSTEM> There's about 6 six cars in Philadelphia you may like. The first one is a nice Standard car pickup in Intercity Terminal starting on March 6th. It's a Hyundai Elantra. <USER> That sounds just fine. <SYSTEM> Should I book it for you? <USER> Yes, please go ahead. <SYSTEM> Okay. I want to make sure. You want a Standard car from Intercity Terminal from March 6th at 9:30 am until March 10th, correct? <USER> Yeah, that is correct. <SYSTEM> Okay. I've booked your car.",

Would you like a Ford Fusion? <USER> Sure, but what does it cost? <SYSTEM> It would cost $116 to book it. <USER> Do you have anything else? <SYSTEM> There is another car available at King Street Station on March 6th. It's a Standard car also. Would you like a Honda Civic? <USER> Maybe. What would that cost? <SYSTEM> It'd cost about $92 in total. <USER> Okay. Is there anything else available? I'd like it in Philadelphia now? <SYSTEM> There's about 6 six cars in Philadelphia you may like. The first one is a nice Standard car pickup in Intercity Terminal starting on March 6th. It's a Hyundai Elantra. <USER> That sounds just fine. <SYSTEM> Should I book it for you? <USER> Yes, please go ahead. <SYSTEM> Okay. I want to make sure. You want a Standard car from Intercity Terminal from March 6th at 9:30 am until March 10th, correct? <USER> Yeah, that is correct. <SYSTEM> Okay. I've booked your car. <USER> Thanks for the help. I also need one hotel room for three that has at least a three star rating. <SYSTEM> Aka University City is a great hotel that's well recommended that has a 3 star rating. Would you like that?",
