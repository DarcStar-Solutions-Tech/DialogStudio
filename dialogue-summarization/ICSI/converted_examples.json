                "E : well , the research topics at this moment is uh , <pause> I P - eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and em <pause> eh <pause> tool <disfmarker> developing tools uh for quality of service , eh <pause> performance analysis .",
                "E : That 's eh <disfmarker> <pause> And we have several projects eh <pause> both Spanish and European projects , ongoing",

                "C : I will um <pause> say something about in which direction it will go",
                "C : and",
                "C : uh",
                "C : Maybe it was my fault that I assumed that the pointer of <pause> Miguel <pause> concerning UMTS services was <pause> deployed to everybody ,",
                "C : but it was only sent to me ,",
                "C : so in the meantime everybody got , I believe , this pointer from me ,",
                "C : and",
                "C : maybe we <disfmarker> It 's a homework , in principle , for the next meeting , to get <vocalsound> <pause> a little bit familiar with these things .",
                "A : Worse than no work .",
                "C : And <pause> um",
                "C : so I believe we will not have <pause> today a very hard technical discussion ,",
                "C : maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days , until the next meeting .",
                "C : And when we are ready with our meeting .",

                "D : Thank you .",
                "D : Well , eh , I <disfmarker> I have <pause> prepared , eh , a really short talk about some of the topics",
                "D : I <disfmarker> I have been doing some w some research work <pause> uh before coming here .",
                "D : And eh , well , mainly I will present",
                "D : uh <disfmarker> <pause> Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation .",
                "D : I will present some ideas and some concepts about <pause> what ad - hoc networks are ,",
                "D : about the issues in media access control in wireless networks ,",
                "D : also about routing in such kind of networks",
                "D : and , eh , I will make some comments also about <pause> uh <pause> the current standards of wireless local area networks",
                "D : and finally , I will present the blueprint of <disfmarker> of my research project or my research uh proposal here .",
                "D : So <pause> the first thing is eh what an ad - hoc network is .",
                "D : You know , uh , an ad - hoc network is made of wireless nodes .",
                "D : These nodes of course can <pause> be mobile nodes ,",
                "D : and , eh in this network there is no <pause> network <pause> infrastructure .",
                "D : So <pause> eh <pause> the only <pause> active thing we have is the mobile nodes .",
                "D : And eh",
                "D : end - to - end communication , is sometimes , uh <pause> <vocalsound> done by direct communication from one node to the other ,",
                "D : because <pause> they can talk to each other .",
                "D : But sometimes it is not possible , this direct communication , because nodes , end <disfmarker> uh source or <disfmarker> and destination nodes are um are too far away .",
                "D : And in this case , <pause> it can be done , communication can be done , by uh using multi - hub routing .",
                "D : So",
                "D : an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes will <pause> route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination .",
                "D : So",
                "D : uh <pause> in a sense , what we have in this kind of networks , <pause> is that , uh <pause> nodes are as both arced as both uh <pause> endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes .",
                "D : And this makes a uh difference from <pause> other kind of network .",
                "D : And well , regarding <pause> the purposes of <pause> what can this kind of network be used for , <vocalsound> eh <pause> we can say that , well , cellular networks are infrastructure - based networks ,",
                "D : in this kind of ad - hoc networks , we don't have <vocalsound> anything uh , with the exception of the network nodes .",
                "D : So , this uh network can be useful for eh <vocalsound> uh <pause> occasions where no available infrastructure is present ,",
                "D : like for example , in <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> eh after some kind of <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> eh um <pause> catastrophe catastrophic event ,",
                "D : or , also when <disfmarker> even when there is a network available , <pause> we don't want , for different reasons , to use the available network .",
                "D : This latt later case can be , for example , the use in military systems ,",
                "D : where <pause> maybe we don't want to use the other <disfmarker> the enemy network infrastructure , for evident reasons .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Hmm ?",
                "C : But you can also , I believe , uh to have an ad - hoc network , where one node is then connecting to the outer world .",
                "C : For instance , what I have in mind , you have a car , where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other , for instance ,",
                "C : but one device decided to go to the G S M network or GPS network , or whatever kind of things .",
                "D : That 's OK .",
                "C : So there 's a certain kind of task uh , for one node within the ad - hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world ,",
                "C : right ?",
                "D : That 's O K .",
                "C : OK .",
                "D : That 's perfect , you know .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : This <disfmarker> in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a <disfmarker> as a gat external gateway , from this network <pause> to connect to other networks ,",
                "C : Right .",
                "D : and of course the underlying <pause> uh protocols can can be , of course , uh IP - based .",
                "D : Uh , OK .",
                "D : Here you have several <disfmarker> several uh , proposed , uh , scenarios for <disfmarker> for used this networks .",
                "D : When no network is available ,",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : And another <disfmarker> another application , for example , NASA is <disfmarker> is uh studying , is uh the use of these networks , these ad - hoc networks , for sending multiple probes , uh , um <pause> uh <pause> missions .",
                "D : So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh <disfmarker> the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission ,",
                "D : the cellular vehicle was only one , and was uh walking around , uh roaming around the base station , which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network ,",
                "D : but it was only one mobile node , of course .",
                "D : Nothing prevents ,",
                "D : except well maybe the cost , to send not only one mobile rover , but ten tons of them , or <disfmarker> <pause> or at least uh several of them .",
                "D : So , <pause> uh",
                "D : higher area could be covered , could be explored",
                "D : and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing , to extend the distance , the maximum distance , than uh a single radio transmission will <disfmarker> would allow .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : And in the other case , or the other area uh of <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> of application , <pause> is the so - called network of sensors ,",
                "D : where <pause> we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area ,",
                "D : let 's say , for example , the forest ,",
                "D : and we can uh take some information",
                "D : uh , for example for <disfmarker> for fire - fighting , we can just launch from a plane , several small sensors ,",
                "D : and uh",
                "D : these sensors can be for example , uh checking that there is no fire ,",
                "D : they can have some kind of uh let 's say infrared technology sensor ,",
                "D : so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of <disfmarker> of sensors , and without any other infrastructure .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : Um , is that really an ad - hoc network ?",
                "B : Because the sensors are not moving .",
                "B : And I think it 's <disfmarker> makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : So .",
                "D : Well ,",
                "D : You know , it 's an interesting question .",
                "D : Uh , the <disfmarker> the main thing about an ad - hoc network is not that nodes move .",
                "D : It is the way of topology changes can happen .",
                "D : The idea that mmm , any change is possible at any given moment .",
                "D : But you can of course ask , \" but if the nodes are not moving , what kind of topology changes can we expect ? \"",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : That 's it .",
                "D : Well , eh , the thing is that usually in <disfmarker> in a n in a network of sensors , what we have , or the idea is to have um , an important number of sensors , and maybe with a high filer rate .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : maybe the batteries are uh <pause> <vocalsound> exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh , let 's say , any sun to recharge its cells ,",
                "B : OK .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh out of order <pause> for other <pause> eh environmenta environmental conditions .",
                "D : So uh the idea is that even when these nodes are not moving , they can start and stop working at uh , let 's say , higher pace .",
                "D : Then , uh <pause> what will happen in a <disfmarker> in a regular network , uh in a network where you don't have or <disfmarker> either mobility or uh this uh on - off uh rate , high rate .",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : Let me go back to your uh uh example .",
                "B : Hmm .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Have in mind some routers are burnt <pause> here , at ICSI or whatever kind of thing ,",
                "C : what will happen then even in a fixed network ?",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : So , if some sensors are getting out of uh <pause> service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving .",
                "B : OK .",
                "B : Mm - hmm ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : OK .",
                "C : And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network .",
                "D : Thank you , Joe .",
                "B : Yeah ,",
                "B : I see .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : Well ,",
                "D : uh , you know , and finally , uh , another non - military applications , where uh maybe a network is available , like for example , a room like this ,",
                "D : where we have , in fa in fact , a wired infrastructure ,",
                "D : but <pause> this uh <pause> possible application of ad - hoc networks could be uh , any place , any meeting room , where we arrive with our computers",
                "D : and eh we just <pause> can communicate seamlessly <pause> to each other without <pause> any kind <pause> of access point , any kind of uh mmm external network ,",
                "D : because <pause> the kind of work we want to do is just only local based ,",
                "D : it 's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person , which is <pause> in front of us .",
                "D : OK ,",
                "D : but we n don't want to product <disfmarker> pro provide , eh , access to the internet or something .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : And , of course , the same eh <disfmarker> the same scenario , <pause> could also happen in a place where there is no <pause> uh , infrastructure available .",
                "D : Let 's say a meeting room uh , in <disfmarker> in the middle of the desert ,",
                "D : OK ? ,",
                "D : without any other network .",
                "D : So",
                "D : the point <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> or the question could be for some of us , the idea of saying \" OK ,",
                "D : That sounds OK ,",
                "D : but why <pause> not to use a longer transmission range , so we can reach any destination in just one hop ? \"",
                "D : This seems to make sense because , <pause> well , uh we are <pause> this way avoiding all the routing problem",
                "D : that , well , we will talk a little bit uh , about routing <pause> later ,",
                "D : but uh",
                "D : it <disfmarker> it seems that i probably that the problem is <disfmarker> is not an easy one ,",
                "D : because uh a node 's moving , the route is changing ,",
                "D : so w one can think that routing in this uh scenario is <disfmarker> is a complex thing .",
                "D : But the problem is <pause> if w we just uh <pause> try to put more power in each tr transmitter ,",
                "D : so this uh transmitter can reach any destination <pause> in only one hop ,",
                "D : what we are doing is uh to rising the power needs of each node ,",
                "D : and also we are reducing the network uh throughput ,",
                "D : because we are only allowing one transmissio one transmission at a time .",
                "D : Because uh , well , we cannot allow several transmissions , several high - powered transmissions at the same time",
                "D : because one is interfering with the other .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : We are <disfmarker>",
                "D : uh I think I 'm not telling <pause> it yet ,",
                "D : but <pause> we are assuming <pause> that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : So that 's why <pause> we cannot allow several transmitters in the same channel at the same time .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not <pause> a good <pause> one .",
                "D : or at least it has the drawbacks um , um , I was telling you .",
                "D : Eh , let 's speak a little bit about the media access issues in <disfmarker> in wireless networks ,",
                "D : Uh , you know , the <vocalsound> easiest eh way to <disfmarker> to show how this works is <disfmarker> or at least one of <disfmarker> I think one of the easiest <disfmarker> is that this drawing , or this picture ,",
                "D : what <disfmarker> what we have is a set of nodes , each one at a different location .",
                "D : At <disfmarker> at <disfmarker> at a <disfmarker> at an <disfmarker> at a given moment this eh node , this dash node is <disfmarker> is transmitting",
                "D : and <pause> uh , the arrows are representing this transmission",
                "D : and the receiving nodes , these three nodes , are receiving the transmission ,",
                "D : and I 'm trying to uh <pause> show the area , the covered area , for <disfmarker> of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle .",

                "D : So , uh , any transmission <vocalsound> has a maximum transmission range ,",
                "D : and uh in the <pause> simpler way , we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : The value of this radius is uh <disfmarker> <pause> in principle , is a fixed value",
                "D : and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter .",
                "D : Of course , uh <pause> this is only our uh <pause> simplife simplified model",
                "D : and of course this can be uh <pause> improved uh <pause> a lot ,",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : And in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one ,",
                "D : but uh for <disfmarker> for what I want to say it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> OK ,",

                "D : OK ?",
                "D : So",
                "D : what are the differences uh , in this <disfmarker> in this eh <pause> wireless transmission , regarding uh to the wireless <disfmarker> to the wired ones .",
                "D : What <disfmarker> what are the d the main differences .",
                "D : Well , the main differences come from the fact that , uh in uh <disfmarker> in uh wireless transmission we have a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal .",
                "D : And the point I 'm trying to show in this picture , is that if for example , this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting , if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme , like for example , CSMA , or something uh uh derivated from it , the problem is that this node will hear the g the m the transmission media ,",
                "D : it won't be able to hear anything",
                "D : so , he will conclude that <pause> no other transmission is going on ,",
                "D : and he will start transmitting .",
                "D : And if he does , what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission ,",
                "D : and this will produce , at least at these two nodes , a collision or a m a m a <disfmarker> a re a bad reception .",

                "D : OK ?",
                "D : because well uh this node is not able to hear this other node <pause> because of the distance <pause> uh , between them .",
                "D : But Uh , this problem , as you can see in the <disfmarker> in the picture , is uh really producing <pause> at least some reception problem at these two nodes .",

                "D : so it is <disfmarker> it is a problem that we have to address",

                "D : And , uh ,",
                "D : well , some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions",
                "D : and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism .",

                "D : OK ,",
                "D : in eh the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the main idea and <disfmarker> and the base of most of this protocols , is what this <disfmarker> the so - called RTS CTS uh dialogue .",
                "D : The idea is that ,",
                "D : uh ,",
                "D : of course , this is only intended for unicast transmissions ,",
                "D : I mean , only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : But not to broadcast . Uh , to all the nodes .",
                "D : OK .",
                "D : For this <disfmarker> for this eh , work , the transmitter has to send a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a reservation packet called RTS , \" Request To Send \" , before eh <pause> being able to send data .",

                "C : OK .",
                "D : The idea is uh , if I want to send you something , I <disfmarker> first of all , I need you to answer me to be sure that you are my neighbor now",
                "D : because maybe you are off or maybe you are uh too far away ,",

                "D : So",
                "D : in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh , used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept a reception is taking place .",

                "C : I didn't get it .",
                "C : Um , what happened when I sent an RTS packet ?",
                "C : Is then the media still occupied for me ?",
                "C : Or , is anybody allowed also to send RTS packets ?",
                "D : Or everybody <disfmarker>",
                "C : Because if I go to an intermediate node , maybe you are communicating to me",
                "C : and I am the intermediate node to the final destination Michael .",
                "C : And Michael send also some RTS packet in the time and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> uh uh uh Jordi too and whatever .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Then you will never come to a really <disfmarker>",
                "C : then you 're always exchanging RTS and non - acknowledgement packets for the RTS .",
                "D : OK .",
                "D : Two <disfmarker> two things .",
                "C : So that 's uh <disfmarker> that 's uh , my <disfmarker> my problem .",
                "D : First of all , <pause> eh , this <disfmarker> this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism ,",
                "D : so it is not connected <pause> with routing <pause> eh , anyhow .",
                "C : Then , fine .",
                "D : And , second point ,",
                "C : OK .",
                "D : eh",
                "C : So it 's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the <pause> transmissions ?",
                "D : RTS <disfmarker>",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : RTS packets can collide <pause> to <pause> other RTS packets .",
                "C : OK .",
                "D : So , <pause> this mechanism <pause> is not <pause> uh preventing <pause> collisions ,",
                "D : it is preventing only data collisions .",
                "D : OK ?",

                "D : So the <disfmarker>",
                "D : And <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> you can say \" OK ,",
                "D : but what is the <disfmarker> what the benefit is ? \"",
                "D : The benefit is that , eh RTS packets and CTS packets are short packets ,",

                "D : Let 's say eh <pause> eh 30 bytes or less .",
                "C : I assume so .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : while data packets can be much mor much bigger .",

                "D : OK ?",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : So",
                "C : Fine .",
                "D : a collision in this short packet <pause> is only wasting a small amount of time .",

                "D : if that way we can warranty that there is <disfmarker> there are <disfmarker> there is no collision uh uh , between data packet , well , this <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> this means a <disfmarker> a huge eh increase in network throughput ,",
                "D : because we well , we <disfmarker> we only waste really small time colliding .",
                "C : OK ,",
                "D : OK ?",
                "C : but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS <pause> packet between neighboring nodes ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : and you send afterwards the data .",
                "C : But the data will be maybe delayed in the <pause> intermediate node because you have always be assured to be uh s uh uh RTS and CTS packets are changed before <disfmarker> <vocalsound> before you can forewarning the data ,",

                "D : yeah ,",
                "D : let me <disfmarker>",
                "C : Maybe it 's better to <disfmarker> to uh , <pause> draw it on the <disfmarker>",

                "D : OK .",

                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : a CTS .",
                "D : That 's OK .",
                "C : So . In the meantime , when he gets this one , he also had to send RTS <nonvocalsound> and then CTS",
                "C : because this is the next next scope of the transmission area ,",

                "B : A car or <disfmarker>",
                "D : because for example , uh <pause> one kind of thing ,",

                "B : Yeah , a cellular phone and a car .",

                "D : maybe later we 'll see some differences .",
                "D : So",

                "D : Uh , if this area is bigger than what is really needed , we are , somehow , wasting a little bit of space .",
                "D : So , uh",
                "D : our first eh work in this area <pause> was <pause> to study different mechanisms <pause> to try to adjust <pause> these transmission values ,",
                "D : these uh the area , the covered area , <pause> for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value ,",
                "D : so <pause> we can <pause> reduce <pause> the not - used space for other simultaneous transmissions .",
                "D : And this will <pause> lead us to a <disfmarker> a better <disfmarker> <pause> to a better network throughput , to higher number of simultaneous transmissions .",
                "D : And , we have , uh mmm , worked about this problem <pause> uh , in two different uh ways .",
                "D : One of these ways has been <pause> try to find a mechanism <pause> to uh calculate <pause> an optimal value <pause> for the transmission range <pause> uh , and to get <pause> an equal value for all the transmitters .",
                "D : So , <pause> the idea in this first work <pause> was <pause> to obtain <pause> a fixed value <pause> for the transmission range .",
                "D : And the second eh work , uh , it is about <disfmarker>",
                "D : Oops !",
                "D : It is about uh , an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for every for every single transmission .",
                "D : So , uh , in this second part of our work , <pause> we are using a different value for every single transmission .",
                "D : So .",
                "D : First point , <pause> what we have proposed is <pause> a way <pause> to obtain <pause> the transmission <pause> range <pause> uh <pause> for uh for an escenario where we know the number of nodes",

                "D : OK ?",
                "D : but without our network getting partitioned ,",
                "D : which is a problem that we are trying to avoid .",

                "D : this is the deployment area of <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> or node ,",
                "D : and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here , <pause> well maybe these nodes in this area , cannot reach the nodes on this other area .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : Uh , so <pause> what can we do to avoid this ?",

                "D : we won't have a hundred percent eh perfect eh channel anyway .",

                "D : I <disfmarker> I just was trying to do something soft ,",
                "D : not to <disfmarker> to bore th the public",
                "D : but of course there are a lot of other smart eh things that are built in , in these protocols ,",
                "C : Right .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : like for example , an automatic , uh <pause> acknowledgement .",
                "D : Some protocols used uh <pause> in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet <disfmarker> some of them use , an eh acknowledge from the receiver ,",
                "D : which is also a short packet ,",
                "D : so you <disfmarker> you are getting some kind of link layer uh <pause> acknowledgement scheme",
                "D : which can save a lot of data transmissions",
                "D : because eh usually when you send a <disfmarker> <pause> a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a frame , you will want to <disfmarker> some kind of acknowledgement back .",
                "D : So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS , well , this takes longer than just a link layer uh , extra packet .",
                "D : That , of course uh <pause> is also contemplated in this eh packet length <disfmarker> length or <disfmarker> included in the RTS and CTS packets ,",
                "D : so , eh , you know , everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted by the receiver .",
                "D : So",
                "D : in fact , eh nnn <pause> some people proposing this mechanism is <disfmarker> is showing a <disfmarker> a b a big improvement",
                "D : and eh there are a lot of other mechanisms , also regarding and a time - out mechanism , or the time - out algorithm for these retries when you <pause> try to send something <pause> and you don't succeed , uh , what <disfmarker> what you the amount of time you have to wait until you retry again .",
                "D : Well , uh , some people is also proposing different things , different eh algorithms with different results .",
                "D : So , in fact , there are a lot of good <disfmarker>",
                "D : I just <pause> was trying to present a <disfmarker> you know <pause> the main ideas .",
                "D : So , I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> you know , ask uh <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> Feel free to ask uh whatever you want ,",
                "D : but <pause> I <disfmarker> I want to insist that <pause> it was just an <disfmarker> uh a simplified uh <pause> version , a light version .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : well , uh <pause> you know finally this algorithm , eh , as I was telling , eh what it 's doing is to check <pause> with the receiver <pause> the power level to be used .",
                "D : And it is very simple to see that some advantages <pause> can <disfmarker> some advantage can be obtained ,",

                "C : OK , this is a question not directly related to these things ,",

                "C : Uh , do you assume that <pause> power control will be issue also in the <pause> next years ?",
                "C : In other words , um <pause> is <pause> the <pause> um <pause> success of having more power within the devices in maybe three year , four years , five years , for batteries , and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> @ @ and sofort so on",

                "D : Uh , If , for example , your car <pause> uh you <disfmarker> you have uh an endless <pause> uh source of <disfmarker> of gas , do you think <pause> it will <disfmarker> it will be a problem , <pause> the amount of gas your <disfmarker> your car is <disfmarker> is using ?",

                "D : But , it is a problem because <pause> you are using more area <pause> than you should .",
                "D : And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place <pause> at the same time .",
                "D : And therefore <pause> uh the problem is not only connected to <disfmarker> to the <disfmarker> to the power",

                "D : because now <pause> the problem <pause> with transceivers <pause> is that a lot of power <pause> is uh <pause> consumed <pause> at the logic of the transceiver ,",

                "D : So , <pause> the problem now <pause> is that eh most of the power <pause> uh , uh t uh a wireless network <pause> card <pause> is consuming , <pause> is <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> is drawn <pause> by the <disfmarker> by the eh logic control of the card .",

                "D : and probably",
                "D : because now it is the main factor , the main consumption factor , <pause> is the logic inside .",
                "D : In the same way , at <disfmarker> as <disfmarker> as it happened with <disfmarker> with processors , for example .",

                "C : But maybe something like a control load level or something like that , seems to be for me <pause> possible .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : Right ?",
                "D : You know , uh if you are curious , uh I can <disfmarker> I can <disfmarker> <pause> I can provide you the n <pause> some of the proposals",

                "C : OK .",
                "D : And eh , finally , <pause> the other <disfmarker> the other thing , which is also under research or under study <pause> is , uh to have some kind of a power - aware routing .",
                "D : There are some proposals , too .",
                "D : So that way you could <disfmarker>",
                "D : routing function could be <pause> connected <pause> with uh global or local power consumption .",
                "D : So , for example , you could ask <pause> to u nnn , the network to transmit your packet <pause> with the lowest <pause> uh global <pause> uh consumption",
                "D : or with your <pause> lowest <pause> local consumption , for example .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : I mean , would the option for me to <disfmarker> to use less power <pause> when sending a packet is to send it to <pause> the closest neighbor .",
                "D : OK , assuming that I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm also using s or having some kind of power control thing .",
                "D : so that way <pause> transmitting to the closer <disfmarker> close <disfmarker> to my closer node , <pause> is , uh <pause> something that requires <pause> less effort <pause> than sending to a more distant node .",
                "D : Maybe <pause> the closer node <pause> is not a good uh <disfmarker> it is not in the good direction to the <disfmarker> to reach the destination .",
                "D : But <pause> it is for sure <pause> the <disfmarker> the less expensive uh <pause> thing for me .",
                "D : OK ?",
                "D : But probably this uh <disfmarker> <pause> this is not <pause> something really useful .",
                "D : And that ca <pause> what can be u really useful <pause> is to reduce the global <pause> power consumption in the routing function .",
                "D : So ,",
                "D : because in this way ,",
                "D : well , maybe one node is <disfmarker> <pause> is <pause> being forced to use more power",
                "D : but <disfmarker> but if we take a look at the whole thing , <pause> well , we can ask for a <disfmarker> a low <pause> consumption route ,",
                "D : well , the same way",
                "C : Yeah , but the <disfmarker>",
                "D : as we are asking , for example , when we want <pause> uh some packet to be shipped in the real life , <pause> we can go and say \" well , <pause> we will <disfmarker> we are happy with this <pause> UPS <pause> ground system .",
                "D : What we want w is two - day <pause> delivery service , <pause> or w twenty - four hours <pause> service , and we are willing to pay more or less <pause> for this service .",

                "D : So , these are more or less uh some open problems ,",

                "D : because they can say \" OK , hundred meters is <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> <pause> is <pause> an acceptable distance ,",
                "D : let 's say , for communicating inside a building , inside a <disfmarker> a small office .",
                "D : So , <pause> uh some people , I think , is being tempted to <pause> think that Bluetooth could <pause> provide them <pause> uh , some kind of local connectivity ,",

                "D : Eh , however , I think that the <disfmarker> that the <disfmarker> <pause> When you have tried <pause> uh <pause> current eh standard eh working devices , <pause> you <disfmarker> you <disfmarker>",
                "D : working at <disfmarker> at eleven megabits per second , you cannot <disfmarker> <pause> you cannot switch to another thing , to another slower thing .",
                "D : But uh <pause> even when they are using the same <disfmarker> the same uh , um <pause> area of a s a spectrum ,",
                "D : because Bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : eh the technologies are different ,",
                "D : you know eh Bluetooth <pause> eh is using a frequency hopping system",
                "D : and uh",
                "D : mmm",
                "D : both uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping , <pause> spread the spectrum techniques , <pause> are also intended <pause> to provide uh interference l uh less , uh <pause> data transmission .",
                "D : So , the idea is that <pause> these <pause> two techniques <pause> are intended not to interfere <pause> with any other thing .",
                "D : So , <pause> even when I haven't tried , <pause> and I cannot tell you for sure , <pause> I think that <pause> the only problem <pause> one network will encounter <pause> uh in the presence of the other <pause> is a little bit <pause> of more noise .",
                "D : And this will produce a little bit <pause> less throughput ,",
                "D : but nothing more .",
                "D : I don't expect any <disfmarker> any <pause> more problem .",
                "D : even <pause> the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the own Bluetooth specification <pause> is also",
                "D : assuming that another Bluetooth <pause> or several Bluetooth <pause> networks <pause> c will be <disfmarker> could be <pause> in the same area of space",
                "D : and they are using the same <pause> hopping technology , frequency hopping technology .",

                "D : So <pause> uh <pause> if several Bluetooth networks can <disfmarker> can uh coexist without a problem , <pause> I don't see any problem will <disfmarker> will happen if <disfmarker> if we <pause> want to <disfmarker> to make coexist <pause> one uh Bluetooth with another wireless uh local area network technology .",
                "C : Well that 's a good news , OK ?",
                "D : Yeah . I think so .",
                "C : But anyway , <vocalsound> um based on your uh uh <pause> initial scenario I believe because Bluetooth is on one chip ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : like you have now your UCB buss or whatever connectivity , you will have your Bluetooth connectivity .",
                "D : Five bucks .",

                "D : Five bucks chip .",

                "D : Hmm - hmm - hmm .",
                "C : Yeah , or will be Bluetooth - based .",
                "D : Will be .",
                "C : Yeah , and this is <disfmarker> this is eh within maybe an uh wireless LAN .",
                "D : Will be .",
                "C : So , despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still",
                "D : In fact <disfmarker> in fact Bluetooth is also designed",
                "C : within one <disfmarker> one area .",
                "C : Yeah .",

                "D : what <disfmarker> <pause> the <disfmarker> the spark of <disfmarker> of my <disfmarker> <pause> of my work here , or at least , of what I <pause> was proposing to work here , <pause> is <pause> the fact that <pause> these two model uh two modes of operation , I was telling you here <disfmarker> <pause> that you have to choose at the driver level <pause> if your network adaptor <pause> is working in an <pause> access point - based environment or in ad ho <pause> in an <pause> ad - hoc environment . <pause> I see this as a <disfmarker> as a limitation",
                "D : because I think that <pause> uh when you have to choose among two options , well , mmm , <pause> maybe you are <pause> saying \" no \" to some of the benefits the other option , <pause> different than the one you are choosing , <pause> could provide you .",
                "D : And I envision an <disfmarker> an <disfmarker> an m <pause> <pause> an escenario <pause> where <pause> eh <disfmarker>",

                "D : So <pause> if we are not able <pause> to reach any access point <pause> but we are able to reach another network <pause> node , <pause> well , <pause> maybe this <pause> network node <pause> could do <pause> me the favor <pause> to reach or to forward my packets to the access point .",
                "D : So <pause> the main idea , the driving force here , <pause> is <pause> to uh <pause> try to obtain <pause> uh , let 's say , hybrid <pause> mode",
                "D : which allows <pause> an adaptor to work either in the access point or in the <disfmarker> <pause> eh <pause> in the ad - hoc mode <pause> in a seamless way .",

                "D : at least for the manufacturers of access point",
                "D : because well , they probably are very happy of selling a lot of them .",

                "D : or , <pause> when we have <pause> several technologies <pause> uh in <disfmarker> <pause> overlapped in a certain area , <pause> why can't we use <pause> the closest and the cheapest , maybe , technology ,",

                "D : And <pause> on the other hand , <pause> what are the billing <pause> implications of this behavior ?",

                "D : but <pause> what happens <pause> if I 'm working <pause> uh , let 's say , uh across a mall , <pause> and <pause> at a given moment I 'm using <pause> the small <pause> base station of a cordless phone <pause> that is inside the shop I 'm at the window of ?",

                "C : Maybe one last question from my side",
                "C : because I bring it up , <pause> uh concerning the proposal , some kind of active routing mechanism .",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : It 's going in a quite different direction as <disfmarker> as <disfmarker> as <disfmarker> as the traditional things discussed in the ITF",
                "C : and I currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic uh , within the I T",
                "C : Do you have certain kind of experience or do you know certain activities uh , in that area ?",
                "D : Nnn , no to both q <pause> to both questions .",
                "C : OK .",
                "D : I don't have previous experience",
                "D : I don't eh know if <disfmarker> uh where it will <disfmarker> <pause> it would fix .",
                "D : However , <pause> eh you know I 'm just doing <pause> this presentation",
                "D : uh <pause> some <pause> somehow a review <pause> of my previous work .",
                "C : I know , yeah .",
                "D : So eh this eh doesn't mean that <disfmarker>",
                "D : I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm probably <pause> getting involved a little bit more in this active routing thing .",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : So uh <pause> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> maybe I will be able to <disfmarker> hopefully I will be able to <disfmarker> to give you a better answer in the future .",
                "C : Oh , OK .",
                "C : One more time , many thanks Miguel .",
                "C : So .",
                "D : Oh , than thanks , Michael , for your computer .",
                "A : No problem .",
                "C : So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal .",
                "D : Should I power off it ?",

                "C : so he will get the <pause> colored one .",

                "C : and take a look to <disfmarker>",
                "D : which is the proper answer ?",

                "A : That 's the proper answer .",
                "D : Th - this one ?",

                "C : Kill the computer .",
                "C : Uh , So I started uh , for <disfmarker> for advertising the project proposal here to provide a few slides",
                "C : I think , first of all , Wilbert , is not here ,",
                "C : second um , the <pause> um link here <pause> was uh enabling UMTS services and application ,",
                "C : uh , I assume <nonvocalsound> was not read <pause> yesterday night .",
                "C : So <pause> I suggest we go roughly to the slides here",
                "C : and um",
                "C : The <disfmarker> the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes .",
                "C : And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um Wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible .",
                "C : There 's a @ @ for uh current <disfmarker> uh uh uh for <disfmarker> for fast <pause> changes within this network .",
                "C : And that means , if you go to slide number three , <nonvocalsound> that <pause> we <pause> have <pause> um <pause> the possibility to <disfmarker> to um <pause> having normal features in the mobile access network ,",
                "C : and <disfmarker>",
                "C : and <pause> um",
                "C : and <pause> um <pause> also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to <disfmarker> to uh use novel things",
                "C : and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and new protocols and new technologies within this network .",
                "C : On the other hand , in the internet backbone , uh <pause> we <disfmarker> it is i impossible",
                "C : and we see it on several examples",
                "C : like this , MPLS ,",
                "C : there 's quality of service support , and multicast",
                "C : and all this kind of thing ,",
                "C : that , based on the success of the internet backbone , it 's become uh <pause> very unflexible , to p uh fo for the provision of these things .",
                "C : So , if <pause> we are going to offer building blocks , and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks , taking into account , <pause> without modifying <pause> the end - to - end scope , then I think it 's really beneficial work ,",
                "C : also for the use of interactive multimedia application ,",
                "C : so <pause> as it is described in the uh <pause> project proposal .",
                "C : Um <pause> the point is that um <pause> to start <pause> with um <pause> a bigger cluster of co uh <pause> of potential partners to do this really really really big work ,",
                "C : seems not to be feasible in the next time .",
                "C : because if you have settled everything , and discussed everything and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and uh <disfmarker> without any money in the background , and a lot of money in the background ,",
                "C : that is not uh feasible from my point of view .",
                "C : Nevertheless , I discussed , with a lot of partners , these things .",
                "C : And today , <pause> uh Michael and me , we were on the UCB to discuss with a guy who is a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff .",
                "C : They are going in that direction .",
                "C : They have a small project funded by NSA <disfmarker>",
                "C : NSF ,",
                "C : um , f for this \" intelligent classroom \" , is a little bit exaggerated , I believe ,",
                "C : but going in that direction .",
                "C : So there are a lot of interest ,",
                "C : but without really <pause> hard money in the background , it is very hard to come to the initial steps .",
                "C : And uh Juan Peire , one of the uh members of this NSA group has <pause> uh <pause> identified a certain kind of s start money , I would like to say .",
                "C : So maybe if you start with a small cluster of um the constraints of this funding ,",
                "C : and that means uh six universities and <disfmarker> and institutions",
                "C : uh , three in USA and three in Europe .",
                "C : and of course , they are uh including the NSA group",
                "C : and maybe that seems to be very reasonably , for me .",
                "C : But then we have to align the project proposal in that sense .",
                "C : Because then we cannot do <disfmarker> do anything as it is described in the <disfmarker> in the bigger scope .",
                "C : So the point is <pause> um <pause> to reduce the overall picture , which I described in a few words , to the fact that we have really some work packages where we can focus on it ,",
                "C : still fitting into the big picture .",
                "C : Yeah ?",
                "C : And so that will be the task of the next weeks .",
                "C : And <pause> uh",
                "C : I <pause> hope that everybody is doing his homework concerning @ @ for instance",
                "C : uh alternative to the intelligent classroom maybe that we <pause> h can start here only with the N S A group",
                "C : within this big picture",
                "C : um <pause> with some work",
                "C : that we put the pieces together .",
                "C : Because I believe many are very flexible here",
                "C : accounting also the <pause> future - coming uh <pause> joining people of the NSA group , to do some work here .",
                "C : And if <pause> we are starting with a very very very small cluster with a common activity have maybe some starting funding for bigger uh <pause> radius of the <disfmarker> of the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the uh <pause> project proposal , with the mind that maybe at the final stage it will becoming a European proposal with this uh the <disfmarker> the whole funding .",
                "C : That 's uh <pause> my point , and my picture I have in mind .",
                "C : And I will go definitely back to <pause> Germany the tenth of December .",
                "C : That is fixed now .",
                "C : And I hope we can use these remaining weeks <pause> to have really progress in <disfmarker> uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before .",
                "D : Hmm - hmm .",
                "C : Because then I will make <pause> the advertising that is still worth to stay here ,",
                "C : And I hope then Siemens will say OK for me to stay longer here .",
                "C : And then I will come back maybe in the <disfmarker> mid of end of January .",
                "C : So that 's uh it 's a comment to the proposal .",
                "C : So I think everybody should <pause> consider carefully , <pause> based on this statement I made uh next steps",
                "C : and of course everybody has little bit other work to do",
                "C : but it should be <disfmarker> should be always an ongoing process until I will leave <disfmarker> until the tenth of December .",
                "B : You mentioned um six partners of this um work .",
                "C : OK .",
                "B : So you know already what partners are included .",
                "B : OK I didn't have a look at uh slides ,",
                "C : Um",
                "C : yeah",
                "C : I will distribute all the things electronically",
                "B : OK .",
                "C : to all the <disfmarker>",
                "C : OK , take a look to slide of number two ,",
                "B : Just <disfmarker> I 'm just curious .",
                "C : Yeah !",
                "C : You see uh uh University of Mannheim ,",
                "C : University",
                "C : also these are the official ones ,",
                "B : Yeah , sure .",
                "C : You see that in the ICSI US <disfmarker> on the U S A side , I believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : Yeah yeah .",
                "C : Yeah ?",
                "C : but these are then the official ones ,",
                "C : and I would like to have them <disfmarker>",
                "B : And all of them had agreed ,",
                "B : or <disfmarker> ?",
                "C : They say they are very interested in it .",
                "B : OK .",
                "C : Yeah ?",
                "C : Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it ,",
                "C : and I got the statement",
                "C : uh they are very interested in that .",
                "C : They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom",
                "C : but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff .",
                "C : And University of Uppsala , Sweden ,",
                "C : that 's the reason I invited uh Christian Tschudin , the professor who did ten years work in <disfmarker> in active routing .",
                "C : And uh <pause> <disfmarker> OK the Universidad Nacional de Educat",
                "C : Yeah .",

                "C : Then , of course , the whole N S A group",
                "C : and <pause> also of the coordinator of all the things ,",
                "C : then Georgia Tech , I have good relationship to uh the long lasting uh cooperation with Georgia Tech",
                "C : and they did a lot in this area , also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff <pause> and the UCB .",
                "C : We still focusing on maybe we can have uh more professors involved",
                "C : which are <pause> working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff ,",

                "C : So , <disfmarker>",
                "C : But take a look to the slides , I will uh deploy it um uh electronically .",
                "D : Wher - where your slides are available ?",

                "C : And , <pause> maybe you take a look to the <pause> uh last two slides ,",
                "C : um Um ,",
                "C : maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available .",
                "C : So you have , in principle , here now the mapping of <pause> the different areas , um within GPS ,",
                "C : and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS .",
                "C : There is no so much different .",
                "C : Um . You always have the SGSN and UMTS ,",
                "C : they are called three - GSGSN .",
                "C : And you have the protocol stack",
                "C : um in <disfmarker> on the slide number five , to see what uh is going on .",
                "C : And you see the difference .",
                "C : The amazing thing is that you have IP over IP .",
                "C : As you take a look to the <disfmarker> the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and <disfmarker> and all those things .",
                "C : And you have the <pause> GPS tunnel p uh protocol G T P between the G and the S and the GTSN .",
                "C : And <disfmarker> and so on .",
                "C : So uh I believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh <disfmarker> between the um um involved nodes ,",
                "C : and <pause> making it necessary , in principle , to deal with our four building blocks in um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , I believe , in a difficult way ,",
                "C : if , uh , we have in mind quality of service routing , and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> uh qualit uh mobility aspects and <disfmarker> and all this kinds of things for <pause> I P layer functionality .",
                "C : So that 's , in principle , uh an overview , of the protocol stack",
                "C : and the involved nodes ,",
                "C : and I will provide more and more information",
                "C : but um eh I have to also figure out everything from the scratch .",
                "C : I am not a total expert for <disfmarker> for the future <pause> wireless networks .",
                "C : OK .",
                "C : Then I would like to thanks everybody",
                "C : and <pause> if there 's no additional question , comment , or <pause> or <pause> other remarks , <pause> I would like to start with reading uh these numbers .",
                "D : OK , we have <disfmarker>",
                "C : OK , please the next one .",
                "C : OK , thank you",
                "C : Now , please let <disfmarker> don't switch off power ,",
                "C : I have to call Adam ,",

                "F : Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" .",

                "F : \" run hyphen command \" .",
                "F : And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine ,",
                "F : and uh <disfmarker> and run it there",
                "F : and it 'll duplicate your environment .",
                "F : So",
                "F : you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command .",
                "F : So you can say \" run dash command L S \" ,",
                "F : and , um , it 'll actually export that <vocalsound> LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory .",
                "F : So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run ,",
                "F : and um <disfmarker> And that 's a simple way to get started using <disfmarker> using this .",
                "F : And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , <vocalsound> um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use .",
                "F : Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it .",
                "F : Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has ,",
                "F : what its speed is ,",
                "F : what its operating system ,",
                "F : and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program .",
                "F : For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute ,",
                "F : and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that .",
                "F : So .",
                "F : You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent ,",
                "F : all the way down to an individual machine .",
                "F : Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself .",
                "F : So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that .",
                "F : If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up ,",
                "F : and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there .",
                "F : So ,",
                "F : there 's a lot of nice features to it",
                "F : and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines",
                "F : and uh ,",
                "F : right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it",
                "F : and we 're <disfmarker> Uh .",
                "F : The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it .",
                "F : So .",
                "C : So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines ,",
                "F : Yeah .",
                "C : is the rough division of <disfmarker>",
                "F : Exactly .",
                "F : Yeah , you know , I <disfmarker> I sort of got started <comment> using the recognizer just recently",
                "F : and uh ,",
                "F : uh I fired off a training job ,",
                "F : and then I fired off a recognition job",
                "F : and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two <vocalsound> trainings simultaneously",
                "F : s my m my jobs are not getting run . \"",
                "F : So I had to back off a little bit .",
                "F : But ,",
                "F : soon as we get some more machines then uh <disfmarker> then we 'll have more compute available .",
                "F : So ,",
                "F : um ,",
                "F : that 's just a quick update about what we 've got .",
                "G : Um , I have <disfmarker> I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?",
                "F : So .",
                "F : Mm - hmm .",
                "G : So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little <disfmarker> little jobs to do ?",
                "F : Mm - hmm .",
                "G : Um , how do I do it with \" run command \" ?",
                "G : I mean do <disfmarker>",
                "F : You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job",
                "G : Uh - huh .",
                "G : A thousand times ?",
                "F : right ?",
                "G : OK .",
                "F : But you probably wanna be careful with that",
                "F : because um , you don't wanna saturate the network .",
                "F : Uh ,",
                "F : so , um ,",
                "F : you know , you should <disfmarker> you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time ,",
                "F : uh , just because then it would keep other people <disfmarker>",
                "G : Oh ,",
                "G : too much file transfer and stuff .",
                "F : Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with <disfmarker> if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt",
                "F : and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed ,",
                "F : so it 's sort of a sharing thing .",
                "G : OK .",
                "F : Um ,",
                "F : so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time .",
                "F : Um .",
                "F : So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \" , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time .",

                "F : and <disfmarker> and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things ,",

                "D : Uh - huh .",
                "F : So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once ,",

                "A : So",
                "A : that seems to be giving <disfmarker> uh , improving over their uh , system .",

                "A : But , not very significantly .",
                "A : And uh , that was",

                "A : And uh ,",

                "C : No you didn't ,",
                "A : because I <disfmarker> I found that I would have change the value of the update factor .",
                "C : OK .",

                "F : Yeah .",
                "C : But <disfmarker> but it might be uh <disfmarker> In some ways it might be better t to <disfmarker> rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with .",

                "C : and <disfmarker> so we we 'll have a <vocalsound> single place where the stuff is .",

                "D : we <disfmarker>",

                "A : I mean the <disfmarker> the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits",

                "D : One session is only uh like seven <disfmarker>",

                "B : Yeah , well it certainly seems <disfmarker>",
                "D : Uh if <disfmarker> if that 's OK with you to <disfmarker> to , you know , get that stuff uh <disfmarker> to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .",

                "B : Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's <disfmarker>",

                "F : and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll <disfmarker>",
                "A : Oh , OK , OK .",
                "F : I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .",
                "A : Yeah , I haven't done that .",
                "A : So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .",
                "F : Yeah .",
                "A : I 'll try to get to that .",
                "A : OK .",
                "A : So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about .",
                "A : I 'm just gonna do it .",
                "A : And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .",
                "B : You are going to <disfmarker>",
                "A : I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to <pause> suggest edits .",
                "A : And then bleep them out .",
                "B : OK .",
                "A : For the ones that we have .",
                "A : Um <disfmarker>",
                "C : So but it 's just transcripts , not the <disfmarker> not the audio ?",
                "A : Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .",
                "C : OK , yeah , yep .",
                "C : Ah .",
                "A : I mean that 's my intention .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : Because the transcripts might not be right .",
                "F : So <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : So you want people to be able to listen to them .",
                "F : So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ?",
                "F : Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and <disfmarker>",
                "A : Oh , that 's a good point .",
                "A : That 's a good point .",
                "A : Yeah , it 's <disfmarker> it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .",
                "F : Hmm .",
                "F : Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on",
                "A : Well , that was the other point .",
                "F : Oh , was that another one ?",
                "A : Yep , that 's another agenda item .",
                "F : OK .",
                "F : I 'll wait .",
                "A : So , uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too .",
                "A : Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say .",
                "A : The back - end stuff is working out fine .",
                "A : It 's more or less ready to go .",
                "A : I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera",
                "A : and also by the user ID .",
                "A : So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .",
                "A : Uh <disfmarker> The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer .",
                "A : And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy .",
                "A : So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and <disfmarker> and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .",
                "E : Right .",
                "A : But uh <pause> the back - end was pretty smooth .",
                "B : Oh",
                "A : So I think , we 'll have something .",
                "A : It may not be as <disfmarker> As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .",
                "B : I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point .",
                "B : He 's sort of been <disfmarker> been volunteering for everything",
                "B : and <pause> and uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : O K .",
                "B : Finally said he was too busy .",
                "B : I guess we reached it .",
                "A : Yeah , he <disfmarker> he actually <disfmarker> he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it .",
                "A : So .",
                "A : Oh well .",
                "A : Um <disfmarker>",
                "E : And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display ,",
                "E : and I don't know how much more we can do with it <disfmarker>",
                "E : with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom",
                "A : Oh , cool .",
                "E : so , right now it 's just an X Waves",
                "E : and then you have three windows",
                "E : but I don't know , it looked pretty nice",
                "E : and I 'm sure it <disfmarker> think it has potential for a little something ,",
                "A : For a demo ?",
                "E : yeah , for a demo .",
                "A : Yeah , sounds good .",
                "E : So <disfmarker>",
                "B : OK , so again , the issue is <disfmarker> For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on ,",
                "E : Oh .",
                "B : but <disfmarker>",
                "E : OK .",
                "A : So it might just be slides .",
                "E : Yeah , OK .",
                "E : Well , we 'll see , um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Well <disfmarker> <pause> Yeah .",
                "C : I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows",
                "C : so i",
                "C : And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine .",
                "C : So hopefully that will work .",
                "D : Really ?",
                "D : So is that <disfmarker>",
                "D : Because there 's some people um <disfmarker>",
                "D : It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at <disfmarker> at SRI",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : because the um <disfmarker>",
                "C : Yep .",
                "D : we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the <disfmarker>",
                "A : Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .",
                "D : Right .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah",
                "C : but <disfmarker> But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever",
                "C : and that 's not anymore supported .",
                "C : It 's not on <disfmarker> on the web page anymore .",
                "C : But I just wrote an email to <disfmarker> to the author of <disfmarker> to the Snack author",
                "C : and he sent me to one point six whatever library",
                "C : and so it works .",
                "A : Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : but then you can't add our patches",
                "C : and then the <disfmarker> the new version is <disfmarker> is totally different",
                "A : Oh .",
                "C : a and in <disfmarker> yeah , in terms of <disfmarker> of the source code .",
                "C : You <disfmarker> you can't find the Tcl files anymore .",
                "A : Ah .",
                "C : It 's some whatever wrapped thing",
                "D : Mmm .",
                "C : and you can't <disfmarker> you can't access that",
                "C : so you have to install <disfmarker> First install Tcl then install Snack",
                "C : and then install the Transcriber thing",
                "C : and then do the patches .",
                "A : Patch .",
                "D : I <disfmarker> I wonder if <disfmarker> if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along <disfmarker>",
                "A : Ugh !",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : We have <disfmarker>",
                "D : We have ?",
                "A : Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .",

                "D : Oh , OK .",
                "F : So did you um put the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or <disfmarker>",
                "C : No , I haven't done that yet .",
                "C : I 'm <disfmarker>",

                "C : But I definitely will do that .",
                "B : So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this",
                "B : Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the <disfmarker>",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "E : Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation .",
                "C : So <disfmarker>",
                "E : Just three different <disfmarker>",
                "E : It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's <disfmarker>",

                "D : So <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker>",
                "D : But <disfmarker> But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the <disfmarker> you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is <disfmarker> that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .",

                "A : It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .",

                "B : we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have",

                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : so it 'd be a good thing to get in there .",

                "B : um <disfmarker> Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in <disfmarker> <pause> to people .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics",

                "A : And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .",
                "A : So , we 're doing OK on backed up .",
                "A : We 're <disfmarker> We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk .",
                "A : So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical ,",
                "A : but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "A : And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space ,",
                "A : but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data <pause> all at once , in a lot of different ways .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "F : Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .",

                "F : Mm - hmm .",
                "A : and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,",
                "C : An",
                "F : Right .",
                "A : so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around .",
                "A : Um <disfmarker> And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it .",
                "A : One of the things I was thinking is we <disfmarker> we just got these hundred <disfmarker>",
                "A : alright , excuse me <disfmarker>",
                "A : ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .",

                "B : Oh .",
                "A : And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those <pause> because they 'll be in the machine room ,",
                "A : they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .",
                "A : And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .",
                "F : Well , is there <disfmarker>",
                "F : Why not just hang them off of Abbott ,",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .",

                "B : Well , maybe it should get another rack .",
                "D : But you still need to store the disks somehow .",

                "D : Oh .",
                "A : Cuz the SUN <disfmarker> uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives .",
                "A : So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .",
                "D : Mmm .",
                "B : But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> file server <comment> it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .",
                "D : Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .",
                "A : Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions .",

                "F : Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for <disfmarker> if we could get some disk .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "F : I s I sent this out a <disfmarker> a day ago",
                "A : And put it where ?",
                "B : Right .",
                "F : but <disfmarker> and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works .",
                "F : I mean does he just go out and get them and <disfmarker> if it 's OK , and <disfmarker>",
                "A : Yep .",
                "F : So I was assuming he was gonna take over <pause> that .",
                "F : But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .",
                "B : Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him .",
                "B : And just <vocalsound> say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do .",
                "B : And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one ? \"",
                "B : So I mean I think <pause> that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" .",
                "F : Yeah .",
                "A : Wa - a I know what they want .",
                "A : The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : So they don't want to stack up external drives .",
                "A : Um <disfmarker> <pause> And then they want everything else in the machine room .",
                "B : Right .",
                "A : So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?",
                "F : Mm - hmm .",
                "F : I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .",
                "A : Right .",
                "F : So .",
                "B : Right .",
                "B : So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,",
                "D : Th - The <disfmarker>",
                "F : I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the <disfmarker> the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .",
                "B : cuz it <disfmarker>",
                "D : One <disfmarker>",
                "D : Mmm .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "D : One <disfmarker> One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is",
                "F : So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .",
                "D : I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around",
                "D : and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks",
                "D : and <disfmarker> and you know recover the space .",
                "A : Yep .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : No .",
                "B : I think Dave <disfmarker> Dave knows all these things , of course .",
                "D : Right .",
                "B : An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "A : But I <disfmarker> I know that <pause> generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .",
                "A : And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back <disfmarker> the <pause> back up system , rather than on new disk .",
                "D : Mmm .",
                "D : Mmm .",
                "A : So .",
                "B : Well .",
                "B : So .",
                "A : Which <disfmarker>",
                "B : But this <disfmarker> this is a very specific question for me .",
                "B : Basically , we can easily get <pause> one to four disks ,",
                "B : I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it ,",
                "B : it 's no big deal .",
                "B : Uh , but the question is where they go ,",
                "B : and I don't think we can solve that here ,",
                "D : Maybe we can put some disks in the <disfmarker> in that back room there .",
                "B : you just have to ask him .",
                "A : Yeah really .",
                "B : Attach to <disfmarker>",
                "A : Popcorn .",
                "D : To the machine that collects the data .",
                "B : Yeah ?",
                "D : So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there .",
                "D : The only <disfmarker>",
                "F : Hmm .",
                "A : Yeah , it 's just <disfmarker> It 's not on the net , so it 's a little <pause> awkward",
                "D : What do you mean it 's not on the net ?",
                "A : It 's not <disfmarker>",
                "C : It 's not bad .",
                "A : It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S",
                "D : Oh because it 's <disfmarker> because it 's an ACIRI machine ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "D : Oh , oh oh .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "A : And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net ,",
                "A : but Who knows when that will happen ?",
                "F : That might be a good short term solution , though .",
                "D : But that can't be that hard .",
                "D : I mean <disfmarker>",
                "A : No , the <disfmarker> the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room <pause> that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .",
                "D : Oh ,",
                "A : So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "B : Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .",
                "B : If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> jus every ever everybody <disfmarker> everybody has a <disfmarker> has <disfmarker>",
                "A : But Dave has to do all of them .",
                "B : Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing .",
                "B : But at any rate I think that there 's a <disfmarker> there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need",
                "B : and I think we need a <disfmarker> a conversation with <disfmarker>",
                "B : Uh , maybe <disfmarker> maybe after <disfmarker> after tea or something you and I can go down and <disfmarker> and talk to him about it",
                "B : Just say \" wha you know , what should we do right now ? \"",
                "F : How long is David gonna be gone ?",
                "B : Uh , eleven days or something ?",
                "A : Oh my !",
                "B : Yeah",
                "B : basically tomorrow and all of <pause> the week after .",
                "A : And that 's all I have .",
                "B : Um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Let 's see .",
                "B : The only oth thing <disfmarker> other thing I was gonna add was that um <disfmarker> uh , I talked briefly to Mari",
                "B : and uh we had <vocalsound> both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the <pause> last meeting we had here",
                "B : but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next .",
                "B : And I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings ,",
                "B : so something that we wanna do next meeting is <disfmarker> is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done .",
                "B : I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can <disfmarker> I can dream up text but <pause> this is basically gonna lead to the annual report .",
                "B : So <pause> Um <disfmarker> If w",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",

                "B : Um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Or <disfmarker>",
                "D : Because you know I <disfmarker> Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two .",
                "D : So if it could be before that would be be",
                "B : No , no but I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I don't need other folks for the meeting .",

                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting",
                "D : and between you know , whoever 's interested in that",
                "D : because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about",

                "B : Think so ?",

                "D : Um I jus So the latest result was that um",

                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : and <disfmarker> and uh , um , <disfmarker> and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .",
                "A : Hmm .",
                "B : Uh <disfmarker> But uh <disfmarker> which <disfmarker> So that 's what they 're <disfmarker> they 're using now .",

                "B : But <disfmarker> but yeah certainly if we , um <disfmarker>",
                "B : If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was .",
                "B : I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .",

                "D : Right .",
                "D : Well , that was that .",
                "D : And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system",

                "F : Well , I 'm <disfmarker>",
                "F : Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses .",

                "F : And uh so then I 'll train the net .",
                "F : And .",
                "D : An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's <disfmarker> um that the phone set would change .",
                "F : Right .",
                "D : So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight <disfmarker>",
                "F : Eight .",
                "D : forty - eight phones ?",
                "F : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that <disfmarker> that we 've been using so far .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : And that <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> that will probably help , actually ,",
                "F : So it 's a little different ?",
                "D : because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the <disfmarker> as far as just the um , um <disfmarker>",
                "D : Just <disfmarker>",
                "D : You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .",
                "D : And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three .",
                "D : And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the <pause> phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .",
                "B : Sure .",
                "B : Although we <disfmarker> I mean , it 's not that many fewer and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and we take a KLT anyway so we could <disfmarker>",

                "D : Exactly .",
                "D : So <disfmarker> so that was the other thing .",
                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .",
                "D : So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .",
                "B : Yeah , and I think <disfmarker> and we sh again check <disfmarker> we should check with Stephane .",
                "B : My impression was that when we did that before that had very little <disfmarker> uh he didn't lose very much .",
                "D : Right .",
                "F : By just taking the top whatever ?",
                "A : Yep .",
                "B : Yeah",
                "B : yeah .",
                "D : But then <disfmarker>",
                "D : And then something <disfmarker>",
                "D : Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features",
                "D : uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .",
                "B : And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .",

                "B : Yeah .",
                "D : um because <disfmarker> you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News",
                "D : and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard",

                "B : Yeah .",

                "B : Uh . Yeah .",
                "D : Uh . We <disfmarker> we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh <disfmarker> to the dictionary about two years ago",
                "D : which resulted in a <disfmarker> uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard ,",

                "A : And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back <disfmarker> the <pause> back up system , rather than on new disk .",

                "D : Well , it 's that <disfmarker> It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system .",
                "D : Um <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> One thing <disfmarker> I mean <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in past meetings we had um also a you know various <disfmarker> variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the <disfmarker> on the recognition side",
                "D : Liz and Jane probably .",
                "F : Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?",
                "F : But I do I don't <disfmarker> I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder .",
                "B : And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .",
                "B : Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane <pause> when we get a chance , see what they think and <disfmarker>",
                "D : um yot I tested the uh <disfmarker> the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for <disfmarker> for this year 's Hub - five test set .",
                "D : And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the <disfmarker> you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .",
                "D : They <disfmarker> They were <disfmarker> The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .",
                "D : And then the really nice thing was that if <disfmarker> if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .",
                "D : Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems <pause> to <pause> mmm , uh <pause> c combine that .",
                "D : There 's one thing uh <disfmarker> I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end <disfmarker>",
                "D : You know , if you <disfmarker> you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems",
                "D : And then we had some results on <pause> digits , uh , with um <disfmarker>",
                "D : And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .",
                "D : The rest is <disfmarker> is read <disfmarker> is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .",
                "D : A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .",
                "B : Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the <pause> amount of training that there was .",
                "D : But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there",
                "D : You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT <disfmarker> <comment> uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,",
                "D : And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .",
                "D : So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps .",
                "B : Because <disfmarker> because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,",
                "D : Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data .",
                "D : I mean , Wall Street Journal , <pause> uh , take one example .",
                "D : So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the <disfmarker> the digit recognizers to <disfmarker> to use uh something other than TI - digits .",
                "D : And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system",
                "F : Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses .",
                "F : And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with .",
                "F : And uh so then I 'll train the net .",
                "D : So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight <disfmarker>",
                "D : Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that <disfmarker> that we 've been using so far .",
                "D : You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .",
                "D : And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three .",
                "D : And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the <pause> phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .",
                "B : Although we <disfmarker> I mean , it 's not that many fewer and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and we take a KLT anyway so we could <disfmarker>",
                "D : And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .",
                "D : So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .",
                "D : Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features",
                "D : uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .",
                "B : And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .",
                "D : So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs <pause> before we go ahead and train up the <disfmarker> uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .",
                "B : I mean , it 's <disfmarker> it 'd be context independent and so on .",
                "D : So you <disfmarker> you started training with outputs from a <disfmarker> with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?",
                "D : That was probably because your initial system <disfmarker> I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's .",
                "A : they were <disfmarker> they were comparable .",
                "F : I was wondering uh you know what size net I should <disfmarker>",
                "F : Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?",
                "B : Uh , how much training data ?",
                "D : But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .",

                "F : Yeah .",
                "C : So , um ,",
                "C : and it 's a real simple change to make .",
                "C : I mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers ,",
                "C : and you don't do anything else .",
                "F : Oh , this is a <disfmarker>",
                "C : And then you just run .",

                "C : So it 's a very simple change to make",

                "C : Uh , I <disfmarker> I have to look to see what the exact numbers were .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : I <disfmarker> I thought was , like , three , two , two , five ,",

                "A : Mm - hmm .",

                "C : I it makes a big difference .",
                "C : So we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .",

                "C : And so we 've got it <disfmarker>",

                "C : Um , you have to make <disfmarker> you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , <vocalsound> um , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a <disfmarker> a Sparc and points to the right executables .",
                "C : Uh ,",
                "C : and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc .",
                "C : So ,",
                "C : um ,",
                "C : uh , I can <disfmarker> I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work .",
                "A : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : But it 'll <disfmarker> it really increases what we can run on .",
                "E : Hmm . Cool .",
                "C : So , <vocalsound> together with the fact that we 've got these <pause> faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do <pause> these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .",
                "A : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : So .",
                "E : Hmm .",
                "C : So after I did that , then what I wanted to do <comment> was try <pause> increasing the number of mixtures ,",
                "C : just to see , um <disfmarker> see how <disfmarker> how that affects performance .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : So .",
                "B : Yeah . In fact , you could do something like <pause> keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : Exactly .",
                "B : that had more .",
                "B : Yeah .",

                "E : So at <disfmarker> at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's <disfmarker> you 're adding one more mixture per state ,",
                "C : Uh - huh .",
                "E : or <disfmarker> ?",

                "C : Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up .",
                "B : I mean , in these cases , if you go from the <disfmarker> the , uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : I mean , I don't remember the numbers right off ,",
                "B : but if you <disfmarker> if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , <vocalsound> it 's not an enormous difference in the <disfmarker> in the <disfmarker> the training - testing situation ,",
                "B : and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and it 's a really big <vocalsound> performance drop .",

                "B : um <disfmarker>",
                "B : Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance <disfmarker> this is back old on , uh <disfmarker> on Italian <disfmarker> uh , was like <pause> six percent error for the well - matched",
                "B : and eighteen for the medium - matched",

                "B : that <disfmarker> that the goal is to come up with features <vocalsound> that will still give you reasonable performance ,",

                "B : So just <disfmarker> just for example .",

                "C : just to see , um <disfmarker> see how <disfmarker> how that affects performance .",
                "B : Yeah . In fact , you could do something like <pause> keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it",
                "A : There was a conference call this Tuesday .",
                "A : I don't know yet the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> what happened <vocalsound> Tuesday ,",
                "A : but <vocalsound> the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , <vocalsound> uh , things like <vocalsound> the weights ,",
                "B : Do you know who was <disfmarker> who was <disfmarker> since we weren't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from OGI ?",
                "A : I have no idea .",
                "A : So the points were the <disfmarker> the weights <disfmarker> how to weight the different error rates <vocalsound> that are obtained from different language and <disfmarker> and conditions .",
                "A : it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting .",
                "A : Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on",
                "A : well , to <disfmarker> to combine error rates <pause> before computing improvement .",
                "A : And so , perhaps they will change the weights to <disfmarker>",
                "B : Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake .",
                "B : But the question is , do you average the relative improvements <pause> or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?",
                "B : And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .",
                "B : It 's just when you <disfmarker> when you get all done , I think that they pro",
                "B : but I think they started off this process with the notion that <vocalsound> you should be <pause> significantly better than the previous standard .",
                "B : so they said \" how much is significantly better ?",
                "B : And <disfmarker> and so they said \" well , <vocalsound> you know , you should have half the errors , \" or something , \" that you had before \" .",
                "B : But it does seem like",
                "B : i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first",
                "A : But there is this <disfmarker> this <disfmarker> is this still this problem of weights .",
                "A : When <disfmarker> when you combine error rate it tends to <pause> give more importance to the difficult cases ,",
                "A : Some people think that <vocalsound> it 's more important to look at <disfmarker> <vocalsound> to have ten percent imp relative improvement on <pause> well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched ,",
                "A : and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch",
                "C : It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be .",
                "B : I mean , they don they <disfmarker> they don't <disfmarker> they don't really <pause> know , I think .",
                "B : So the argument for that being the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the more important thing , <vocalsound> is that you 're gonna try and do that , <vocalsound> but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when <disfmarker> when <disfmarker> when the , uh <disfmarker> it 's a little different .",
                "B : The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things .",
                "B : I gather that in these meetings it 's <disfmarker> it 's really tricky to make anything <vocalsound> ac <vocalsound> make any <comment> policy change",
                "B : because <vocalsound> <vocalsound> everybody has <disfmarker> has , uh , their own opinion",
                "A : but there is probably a <disfmarker> a big change that will <vocalsound> be made",
                "A : is that the <disfmarker> the baseline <disfmarker> th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps ,",
                "A : And apparently , <vocalsound> uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number .",
                "A : So they want <vocalsound> to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline ,",
                "B : So whose VAD",
                "A : Uh , they didn't decide yet .",
                "A : well , from OGI , these experiments on <pause> putting VAD on the baseline .",
                "A : And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation ,",
                "A : So what happened since , um , <vocalsound> last week is <disfmarker>",
                "A : so spectral subtraction ,",
                "A : and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this .",
                "A : So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization ,",
                "A : so which is similar to <vocalsound> the pro proposal - one , but with <pause> spectral subtraction in addition ,",
                "A : and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction .",
                "A : And what 's happened here is that we <disfmarker>",
                "A : so we have this kind of new , um , reference system which <vocalsound> use a nice <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a clean downsampling - upsampling ,",
                "A : which use a new filter <vocalsound> that 's much shorter",
                "A : and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz ,",
                "B : When you say \" we have that \" , does Sunil have it now , too ,",
                "A : No .",
                "A : Because we 're still testing .",
                "A : Um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case ,",
                "A : um , <vocalsound> but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched <disfmarker>",
                "B : But it has the , uh <disfmarker>",
                "B : the latencies are much shorter .",
                "A : Latency is short <disfmarker>",
                "A : So basically we try to , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh , find <vocalsound> good features that could be used for voicing detection ,",
                "B : There was a <vocalsound> start of some effort on something related to voicing or something .",
                "A : we <disfmarker> w basically we are still playing with Matlab to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> to look at <disfmarker> at what happened ,",
                "C : what sorts of features are you looking at ?",
                "A : So we would be looking at , um , the <pause> variance of the spectrum of the excitation ,",
                "A : which is <disfmarker> should be high for voiced sounds .",
                "B : what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as I recall , is you 're subtracting the <disfmarker> the , um <disfmarker> the mel <disfmarker> mel <disfmarker> <vocalsound> mel filter , uh , spectrum from the FFT spectrum .",
                "B : So it 's <disfmarker> it 's not really an excitation ,",
                "B : but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation .",
                "A : Yeah , that 's right .",
                "A : Right now we just are trying to find some features .",
                "A : Yeah . Hopefully , I think what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,",
                "A : well , to <disfmarker> to obtain a statistical model on these features",
                "A : and to <disfmarker> or just to use a neural network",
                "C : really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced .",
                "B : another way of looking at it is what characterization <vocalsound> of the difference between <pause> the raw data <pause> and this smooth version <pause> is something that you 're missing that could help ?",
                "B : So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference ,",
                "B : and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise ,",
                "B : but it 's more that , <vocalsound> you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data",
                "B : the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best <disfmarker> the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,",
                "B : that <disfmarker> that in fact , well , the data itself is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that you 're working with is not perfect .",
                "B : So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer",
                "B : because you 're just getting some characterization ,",
                "B : one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly ,",
                "B : and , you know <disfmarker> and you 're not getting the excitation anyway , you know .",
                "B : And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that <vocalsound> sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation .",
                "B : And I call that lies because you don't really have that ,",
                "B : you just have some kind of <vocalsound> signal - processing trickery to get something that 's kind of smooth .",
                "B : so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation .",
                "B : That 's why I was going to the <disfmarker> why I was referring to it in a more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a more , uh , <vocalsound> uh , <vocalsound> conservative way ,",
                "B : when I was saying \" well , it 's <disfmarker>",
                "B : it 's the excitation \" .",
                "B : But it 's not really the excitation .",
                "B : well , you don't really get the excitation ,",
                "B : but you get something related to it .",
                "C : And so you said this is pretty <disfmarker>",
                "C : doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise ?",
                "A : It seems ,",
                "A : yeah .",
                "A : So if <disfmarker> if you take this frame , <vocalsound> uh , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance <disfmarker>",
                "C : You end up with a similar difference",
                "A : So we 'll perhaps <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> try to convince OGI people to use the new <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the new filters",
                "B : Uh , has <disfmarker> has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source ,",
                "A : not yet",
                "A : but I wi I will <vocalsound> call them",
                "A : now they are <disfmarker> I think they have more time",
                "A : well , Eurospeech deadline is <vocalsound> over",
                "B : and <pause> he 's been doing all the talking",
                "B : This is <disfmarker> this by the way a bad thing .",
                "B : We 're trying to get , um , m more female voices in this record as well .",
                "B : Make sur make sure Carmen <vocalsound> talks as well .",
                "F : I don't know .",
                "F : I think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it 's better that I don't speak .",
                "D : N um , not not not much is new .",
                "D : So when I talked about what I 'm planning to do last time , <vocalsound> I said I was , um , going to use Avendano 's method of , um , <vocalsound> using a transformation , um , <vocalsound> to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .",
                "D : but , uh , um , I decided <vocalsound> not to do that after all",
                "D : because I <disfmarker> I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow",
                "D : and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , um , <vocalsound> take , um , audio as input , in general .",
                "D : So I decided that I <disfmarker> I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows",
                "D : and then just re - synthesize audio",
                "B : Um , anything to <pause> add ?",
                "E : Well , I 've been continuing reading .",
                "E : I went off on a little tangent this past week ,",

                "E : And I found some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> some , uh , neat papers , <vocalsound> um , historical papers from , <vocalsound> um , <vocalsound> Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai .",
                "E : And they <disfmarker> they did a lot of experiments where th where , <vocalsound> um , they take speech <vocalsound> and , um , e they modify <vocalsound> the , uh <disfmarker>",
                "E : they <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> they measure the relative importance of having different , um , portions of the modulation spectrum intact .",
                "E : And they find that the <disfmarker> the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation <vocalsound> is , uh <disfmarker> is im important for speech recognition .",

                "F : so your point is that it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> it 's uh <disfmarker> the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions .",

                "F : And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , <vocalsound> concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , \" OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , \" you 'll probably find you can't do it all .",

                "F : I still think we could do a lot of them .",
                "F : I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something .",

                "C : And I know that , uh , Stephane 's working from an NT machine ,",

                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "F : So , you <disfmarker> you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do <disfmarker> don't want to have the <disfmarker> the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being <disfmarker> where the computation 's being done if you can help it .",

                "F : Now , we are getting more disk for the central file server ,",
                "F : which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said .",

                "F : you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server .",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "F : Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there .",
                "F : And then that way you <disfmarker> you won't have the <disfmarker> the network <disfmarker> you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others .",
                "C : Mmm .",
                "F : That 's the idea .",
                "F : So , uh , it 's gonna take us <disfmarker>",

                "F : uh <disfmarker>",
                "F : It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get ,",
                "F : uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives",
                "F : and , uh , put them on another <disfmarker> another disk rack .",
                "F : We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had ,",

                "F : But , uh ,",
                "F : we 've put another <disfmarker> I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's <disfmarker> that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch .",

                "F : right ?",

                "F : I see .",

                "G : Yeah , yeah , yeah .",
                "F : probably the on - line <disfmarker> line normalization",

                "E : I necessary to convert .",
                "F : What 's <disfmarker> what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way ,",
                "F : so that , uh , once these <disfmarker> all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank",
                "F : So it seems like there 's <disfmarker> there 's some peculiarities of the , uh <disfmarker> of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out .",
                "F : And then , um , if <disfmarker> if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the <disfmarker> the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line",
                "F : and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less .",
                "F : And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , <vocalsound> concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , \" OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , \" you 'll probably find you can't do it all .",
                "F : so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away .",
                "F : Which of the combinations across <disfmarker> you know , what are the most likely ones ,",
                "F : We 're <disfmarker> over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place ,",
                "F : but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines .",
                "F : And we have reached the <disfmarker> this <disfmarker> the machines are getting faster and faster .",
                "F : So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another .",
                "F : It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get ,",
                "F : uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives",
                "F : Stephane , where you 're doing your computations .",
                "G : It 's Nutmeg and Mustard , I think ,",
                "F : Well , you 're the <disfmarker> you 're the disk czar now .",
                "A : Well , I 'll check on that .",
                "A : Dan <disfmarker> David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk ,",
                "A : um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that <disfmarker> that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space <pause> on other disks .",
                "A : We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott ,",
                "A : uh , but we <disfmarker> I would like to go through <disfmarker> sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also .",
                "G : Yeah , OK .",
                "F : an another question occurred to me is <disfmarker> is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ?",
                "G : Well , we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments .",
                "G : but we think perhaps we can use the <disfmarker> the best , uh , um , uh , normalization scheme as OGI is using ,",
                "G : so , with parameters that they use there ,",
                "F : I mean it 's i i we <disfmarker> we seem to have enough dimensions as it is .",
                "F : I <disfmarker> maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the <disfmarker> for next week 's meeting .",
                "F : Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here .",
                "F : so w we can say what we 're doing ,",
                "F : And , um , also , if you have <pause> sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can <disfmarker> how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to <disfmarker> to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do .",
                "F : And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it .",
                "F : And uh <disfmarker> and the other <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to <disfmarker> to , uh , do something <pause> <vocalsound> on this .",
                "F : I mean he 's doing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> he 's working on other things ,",
                "F : but to <disfmarker> to do something on this project .",
                "F : So the question is , \" Where <disfmarker> where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? \"",
                "F : Let 's fall back to that .",
                "F : But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something <pause> that , uh , an <disfmarker> an additional <disfmarker>",
                "G : and , um , <vocalsound> trying to have a closer look at the <disfmarker> perhaps the , um , <vocalsound> speech , uh , noise detection or , uh , voiced - sound - unvoiced - sound detection",
                "F : What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time .",
                "F : but if we could think of some <disfmarker> some piece that 's <disfmarker> that 's well defined , that he could help with ,",
                "F : he 's expressing a will willingness to do that .",
                "F : So <disfmarker> wh that <disfmarker> so the <disfmarker> the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him <pause> work on the , uh , <pause> multilingual super f superset <pause> kind of thing .",
                "F : Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it <disfmarker> training a net on that , say , um , from <disfmarker> from , uh <disfmarker> from TIMIT or something .",
                "F : wh what would this task consist of ?",
                "G : um , creating the <disfmarker> the superset ,",
                "G : and , uh , modifying the lab labels for matching the superset .",
                "G : Well , creating the mappings , actually .",
                "F : Has OGI done anything about this issue ?",
                "F : Do they have <disfmarker> Do they have any kind of superset that they already have ?",
                "G : Well , they <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> they 're going actually the <disfmarker> the other way , defining uh , phoneme clusters , apparently .",
                "A : So they just throw the speech from all different languages together ,",
                "A : then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ?",
                "G : it 's <disfmarker> it 's OK for um , uh classifying the digits ,",
                "G : but as soon as you will have more words ,",
                "G : well , words can differ with only a single phoneme , and <disfmarker> which could be the same , uh , class .",
                "A : So you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ?",
                "G : Yeah ,",
                "B : Fact , most confusions are within the phone <disfmarker> phone classes , right ?",
                "C : So <disfmarker> so , maybe we could look at articulatory type stuff ,",
                "F : because that 's <disfmarker> that 's the other route to go .",
                "F : To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and <disfmarker> and see where everything is ,",
                "F : and we 're not gonna do that .",
                "F : uh , the second class way of doing it is <pause> to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled",
                "F : and translate them into acoustic <disfmarker> uh , uh <disfmarker> articulatory , uh , uh , features .",
                "F : So it won't really be right .",
                "F : is that we could <disfmarker> we could , uh , just translate <disfmarker> instead of translating to a superset , <pause> just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that .",
                "A : We could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too .",
                "A : So I was thinking , you know <disfmarker> it made me think about this ,",
                "A : that if <disfmarker> it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right .",
                "F : OK , so if <disfmarker> if everybody can get here at six .",
