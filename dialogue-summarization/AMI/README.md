Announcing the AMI Meeting Corpus
The European-funded AMI project (FP6-506811) is a 15-member multi-disciplinary consortium dedicated to the research and development of technology that will help groups interact better. One AMI focus is on developing meeting browsers that improve work group effectiveness by giving better access to the group's history. Increasingly in future, we will be considering how related technologies can help group members joining a meeting late or having to "attend" from a different location. In both cases, a key part our approach is to index meetings for the properties that users find salient. This might mean, for instance, spotting topic boundaries, decisions, intense discussions, or places where a specific person or subject was mentioned. To help with developing this indexing the consortium has collected the AMI Meeting Corpus, a set of recorded meetings that is now available as a public resource. Although the data set was designed specifically for the project, it could be used for many different purposes in linguistics, organizational and social psychology, speech and language engineering, video processing, and multi-modal systems.

The AMI Meeting Corpus consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings. The recordings use a range of signals synchronized to a common timeline. These include close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and room-view video cameras, and output from a slide projector and an electronic whiteboard. During the meetings, the participants also have unsynchronized pens available to them that record what is written. The meetings were recorded in English using three different rooms with different acoustic properties, and include mostly non-native speakers.
