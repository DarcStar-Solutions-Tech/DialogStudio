                "system response": "Scarcity and urgency are two of the strongest mental triggers in marketing because they create a sense of exclusivity and importance around a product or service. By creating a sense of limited availability or a deadline for a promotion, businesses can motivate customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late.\n\nOver the last eight years, many businesses have leveraged these triggers in their marketing campaigns to great success. Scarcity and urgency have been used to sell everything from digital products to physical goods and services, and have proven to be highly effective in driving conversions and increasing revenue.\n\nThis is because scarcity and urgency tap into the natural human desire for instant gratification and fear of missing out (FOMO). When customers believe that they may miss out on a valuable opportunity if they don't act quickly, they are more likely to take action and make a purchase.\n\nFurthermore, scarcity and urgency can be combined with other mental triggers, such as social proof and authority, to create even more powerful marketing campaigns. By demonstrating the popularity and effectiveness of a product or service, businesses can increase the perceived value and urgency of a promotion, leading to even more sales and revenue.\n\nOverall, scarcity and urgency are powerful mental triggers that have been proven to drive results in marketing campaigns.

We then pass these values to the `replacePlaceholders()` method, which iterates over the entries in the `replacements` map and replaces each placeholder in the input string with its corresponding value using the `replace()` method. Finally, the `replacePlaceholders()` method returns the modified string, which is printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```csharp\nThis is a new student at point 3, 4\n```\nNote that you can modify the `replacements` map to include additional placeholders and their corresponding values, and the `replacePlaceholders()` method will automatically replace them in the input string.",
