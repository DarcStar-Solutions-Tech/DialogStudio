The reason being that they would make it easier to deal with different linguistic units, like frames and utterances. Eventually, the team was skeptical of using something that would be hard to learn, like ATLAS. Nonetheless, they wanted to explore their options.

Try {disfmarker} let me just say \" Landmark \" . If the thing is a landmark , you know , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} then there 's another thing that says if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} if it 's closed or not , at the moment . Alright , so you have nodes . Right ? And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's \" two to the N \" Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify \" three times \" , uh , \" two to the N \" probabilities . Right ? That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be .

So {disfmarker} right ? So , for example , if we don't really know {vocalsound} if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state .

So {pause} The idea is that , each of these EI {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} represents what this would be {disfmarker} if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? So , for example , suppose that the person {disfmarker} I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . But none of the other {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sort of cues really apply . Then , {vocalsound} this would be {disfmarker} W The {vocalsound} this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then {disfmarker} this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability , uh {disfmarker} with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say {disfmarker} Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? and our example G would be , um , {vocalsound} a majority vote ? Right ?",

They then moved onto discussing a new role, the instructor, who would help experimental participants figure out their intentions. This would eliminate a pre-written set of goals for the participants. Participants also discussed how the schema would incorporate other information, like choosing movies, and how more complex actions, like that of purchasing goods, could be incorporated into the source-path-goal schema. Finally, the participants concluded that an SPG schema of a different kind, one that can transfer previously acquired information, may be more helpful.

                "Grad C : Anyhow , um the uh Yeah , not only Also we will talk about Linguistics and of course Computer Science .",
                "Grad G : Mm - hmm .",
                "Grad C : Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them ,",
                "Grad B : Right .",
                "Grad C : and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid that , and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the {disfmarker} the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those , and um there the idea is now that next actually we {disfmarker} we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it {disfmarker} it 's getting more complicated . So if you know anyone interested in {disfmarker} in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to {disfmarker} to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast . Um {vocalsound} the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks \" go shopping \" um \" take in uh a batch of art \" um \" visit {disfmarker} do some sightseeing \" blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , sort of analogous to what Fey has started in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in compiling {disfmarker} compiling here and already {disfmarker} she has already gone to the trouble of {disfmarker} of anchoring it with specific um o {comment} um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . And um . So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , such as if {disfmarker} if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide \" OK , I wanna do that at this place \" , sort of make up their own itinerary a and {disfmarker} and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with {disfmarker} with symbols for the objects . And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that \" ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here \" and \" I wanted to maybe take a picture of that \" and \" maybe um eat here \" and then goes in and solves the task with the system , IE {comment} Fey , and um and we 're gonna try out that {disfmarker} Any questions ?",
                "Grad G : so um y you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was {disfmarker} so you still have the {disfmarker} the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was ?",
                "Grad C : Mm - hmm . Yeah .",
                "Grad G : But they will um {disfmarker} There 's nothing that says you know \" these are the things you want to do \" so they 'll say \" well these are the things I want to do \" and {disfmarker} Right , so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ?",
                "Grad C : Hopefully .",
                "Grad G : OK . Mm - hmm .",
                "Grad F : So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ?",
                "Grad C : Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the {disfmarker} that information and An",

                "Grad G : OK .",
                "Grad E : So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?",
                "Grad C : Yeah a and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their names",
                "Grad G : Mm - hmm .",
                "Grad C : and we want to maybe ask them , if you have {disfmarker} get it sort of isolated street the {disfmarker} the , whatever , \" River Street \" , and they know that {disfmarker} they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange German names . And then we 're going to have another {disfmarker} we 're gonna have w another trial run IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay for who {disfmarker} those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI .
