                "B : but I think it 's a little bit more complex .",

                "B : So , when we input something , we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these .",
                "B : Right ?",
                "C : OK .",
                "B : So there is no way of telling it t not to tell us about the EVA <pause> values .",
                "C : Yeah , wait I agree ,",

                "B : So <disfmarker> so we get this whole list of <disfmarker> of , um , things ,",
                "B : and the question is what to do with it ,",
                "B : what to hand on ,",

                "B : in a sense .",
                "B : So y you said if you <disfmarker> \" I 'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not \" , then I just look at that node ,",
                "B : look which one <disfmarker>",
                "C : Look at that Struct in the output ,",
                "C : right ?",
                "B : Yep .",
                "B : Look at that Struct in the <disfmarker> the output ,",

                "B : And , um ,",
                "B : the reason is <disfmarker> why I think it 's a little bit more complex or why <disfmarker> why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is <disfmarker>",
                "B : Um .",
                "B : So . The , uh <disfmarker>",

                "B : Right ?",

                "B : or let 's call this <disfmarker> this \" Look - At - H \"",
                "B : He wants to know something about the history of .",
                "B : So he said , \" Tell me something about the history of that . \"",

                "C : I just realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er , my and my microphone .",
                "C : So then , the Bayes - net that would merge there , that would make the decision between Go - there , Info - on , and Location , would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted ,",
                "C : and based upon that node , then you would look at the other stuff .",

                "A : Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look <disfmarker> like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node ,",
                "A : right ?",
                "A : Cuz , that 's what <disfmarker> I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node .",

                "D : So it 's pretty much the same problem ,",
                "B : Yeah <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> it 's apples and oranges .",

                "B : Nuh ?",
                "B : I mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time .",
                "B : So either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes , and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant ,",

                "A : Mmm .",
                "B : or you just make a p @ @ <comment> a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those .",

                "A : is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system ,",

                "A : But to me it just <disfmarker> it just meant a practical <vocalsound> point that um if we want to <vocalsound> publish results on digits that <disfmarker> that people pay <vocalsound> attention to we probably should uh <disfmarker>",
                "A : Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get <disfmarker> show some <vocalsound> nice improvement on something that 's <disfmarker> that 's uh , uh <disfmarker> it seems like too large a number ,",

                "E : Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we still have to think how to <disfmarker> where to put it",
                "E : uh either some delay",
                "E : and we <disfmarker> if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work ,",
                "E : because on the server side features you already have LDA applied <vocalsound> from the f from the terminal side",
                "E : and <vocalsound> so you accumulate the delay",

                "A : This is the one they had originally ?",
                "A : Yeah , but they had to <pause> get rid of it because of the space ,",

                "A : But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely .",
                "A : I <disfmarker> I don't know what the thinking was amongst the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the <vocalsound> the ETSI folk",
                "A : but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there <disfmarker>",
                "E : They just want , apparently <disfmarker> they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and <disfmarker> and VAD or frame dropping",
                "E : But they still <vocalsound> want to <disfmarker> just to give some um <vocalsound> requirement for this VAD",
                "E : because it 's <disfmarker> it will not be part of <disfmarker> they don't want it to be part of the standard .",
                "E : So there just will be some requirements that are still not <disfmarker> uh not yet uh ready I think .",
                "A : but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's <pause> VAD .",
                "A : We could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller",
                "A : You know , as long as it did the job .",
                "E : Uh I designed a new <disfmarker> a new filter",
                "E : because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , <vocalsound> there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds",
                "E : and <vocalsound> uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s",
                "E : Both should have sixty - five because <disfmarker>",
                "A : You didn't gain anything , right ?",
                "E : and uh it 's running .",
                "E : Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter .",
                "E : Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff .",
                "D : No , I w <vocalsound> I begin to play <vocalsound> with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision .",
                "D : And we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they <disfmarker> we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the <vocalsound> sq the variance <vocalsound> between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> after the um mel filter bank .",
                "D : And , well , is more or less robust .",
                "D : Is good for clean speech .",
                "E : So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and <disfmarker>",
                "E : which are the variance of it and <disfmarker>",
                "A : So now I wonder <disfmarker>",
                "A : I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum",
                "A : Um . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you <disfmarker> do you want to totally ignore that ?",
                "A : I mean , clearly a <disfmarker> a very big <disfmarker> very big cues <vocalsound> for voiced - unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on ,",
                "E : Well , this would be <disfmarker> this would be perhaps an additional parameter ,",
                "D : Yeah because when did noise clear <nonvocalsound> in these section is clear",
                "A : I mean , <vocalsound> certainly if <vocalsound> you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features .",
                "A : But , you know , people look at <disfmarker> at slope and <vocalsound> uh first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power .",
                "A : Each <disfmarker> each feature is <vocalsound> by itself not enough .",
                "A : Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some um probable <vocalsound> um harmonic structure .",
                "E : yeah , it 's <disfmarker> it 's another problem .",
                "E : If you look at this um spectrum ,",
                "E : Is it <vocalsound> the mel - filters ?",
                "E : and what we clearly see is that in some cases ,",
                "E : and the <disfmarker> the harmonics are resolved by the f",
                "E : Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering ,",
                "E : and it happens <vocalsound> for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters <vocalsound> is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .",
                "E : so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that <disfmarker> that 's smoother on low frequencies .",
                "A : What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT",
                "A : you could <disfmarker> you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate <disfmarker> estimate uh pitch .",
                "A : And uh uh , given <disfmarker> you know , given that , uh <vocalsound> you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was <disfmarker> was explained by <disfmarker> <vocalsound> by uh uh those harmonics .",
                "A : It 's uh a variant on what you 're s what you 're doing .",
                "A : But as you say it 's not that smooth here .",
                "A : And <disfmarker> and so if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with <vocalsound> quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so",
                "A : What 's up with you ?",
                "B : Um <vocalsound> our t I went to <vocalsound> talk with uh Mike Jordan this <disfmarker> this week",
                "B : um <nonvocalsound> and uh <vocalsound> shared with him the ideas about um <vocalsound> extending the Larry Saul work",
                "B : and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M",
                "B : so like later down the line when <vocalsound> we 've come up with these <disfmarker> these feature detectors , how do we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> how do we uh <vocalsound> you know , uh model the time series that <disfmarker> that happens",
                "B : um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> and we talked a little bit about <vocalsound> factorial H M Ms and how <vocalsound> um when you 're doing inference <disfmarker> or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> for these H M",
                "B : and <vocalsound> the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> don't over - alert the problem",

                "B : and said <disfmarker> said this is <disfmarker> this is something very do - able and can learn a lot",
                "B : yeah , I 've just been <vocalsound> continue reading um about certain things .",
                "B : thinking of maybe using um <vocalsound> um m modulation spectrum stuff to <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> as features um also in the <disfmarker> in the sub - bands",
                "B : because <vocalsound> it seems like <vocalsound> the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of <disfmarker> of certain um words and stuff",
                "C : so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work",

                "C : s so I 'm <disfmarker> I guess my first stab actually in continuing <vocalsound> his work is to um <vocalsound> re - implement this <disfmarker> this thing which um <vocalsound> changes the time and frequency resolutions",

                "F : And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript .",

                "C : Good .",
                "F : And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous .",
                "F : Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that .",
                "F : So <disfmarker> so by saying <disfmarker> if I just said \" Name one \" then that means name one formal",
                "F : and we 're talking about formal struc <comment> Which <disfmarker> which makes sense .",
                "F : Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that ,",
                "F : in which case you could just indicate \" here I mean the meaningful for some reason \" .",
                "F : Right ?",
                "F : Or <disfmarker> Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , \" George and Jerry walk into the room in that order \" .",
                "F : So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "F : But <disfmarker> but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now",
                "F : and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on .",
                "F : OK , and so in terms of the <disfmarker> the relations ,",
                "F : you know , as usual they 're before and ends .",
                "F : I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation",
                "F : but in form you might also have a value binding .",

                "F : There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below",

                "F : OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just <disfmarker> are just bindings .",

                "F : which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings .",
                "F : And so it was an issue whether constraints <disfmarker> um , there were some linguists who reacted against \" constraints \" , saying , \" oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it shouldn't be called a constraint \" .",
                "F : But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ?",

                "C : Good .",

                "C : Right .",
                "A : then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into <disfmarker> onto your <disfmarker> your white piece of paper .",

                "A : And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that ,",

                "A : You may have some general rules as to how things can be <disfmarker> can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the initial notes .",
                "A : But it 's <disfmarker> in that respect it 's completely scalable .",
                "A : Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration .",
                "A : It 's just you need an ontology of the domain",
                "A : and you need the context dependent modules .",
                "A : And if this can be made to work at all , <vocalsound> that 'd be kind of funky .",
                "C : Um , it sounds to me like you want P R",
                "A : P R Ms - uh , PRM",
                "A : I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net <disfmarker>",

                "C : No , no , you can't .",
                "C : See the <disfmarker> the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form .",
                "C : So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can <disfmarker> then you can unfold it .",

                "A : Mm - hmm , yeah .",
                "A : No , I was m using it generic .",
                "A : So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models .",
                "A : Whatever you write it .",
                "C : Well , no , but it matters a lot",
                "A : In <disfmarker>",
                "C : because you <disfmarker> what you want are these generalized rules",

                "C : th that you then instantiate in each case .",

                "C : Yeah , and that 's <disfmarker>",
                "A : That 's ma maybe the <disfmarker> the way <disfmarker> the only way it works .",
                "C : Yeah , that 's the only way it could work .",
                "C : I <disfmarker> we have a <disfmarker> our local expert on P R",

                "B : Yeah , yeah , you are <pause> generating it .",
                "B : Well , that <disfmarker> that was part of the question ,",

                "B : So the question is do you know of resources that we could use .",
                "B : So are there grad students or undergrads or just commercial services ?",
                "D : Yes .",
                "D : Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've <disfmarker> I 've been involved with some of that . At <disfmarker> at CogSci ,",
                "D : um <disfmarker> So , Susan E Susan Ervin - Tripp , who you know um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing",
                "A : Hmm .",
                "D : and they c you know , you can give them like <disfmarker>",
                "D : if you give them a little bit of instruction and <disfmarker> and make it interesting for them they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s",

                "D : Because what you do is , you can <disfmarker> you know , build it into some sort of a <disfmarker>",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : Oh , really ?",
                "B : So we only have to give them credits ,",
                "B : We don't have to give them money ?",
                "D : Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for <disfmarker> you know . of some <disfmarker> of some sort .",
                "B : Oh , you do have to pay them .",
                "A : Awesome .",
                "D : What I mean is it 's not necessarily monetary .",
                "D : But if they feel like they 're getting something out of it , sometimes you can do it that way .",

                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : And otherwise , as part of a grant , you can <disfmarker> you can do it .",
                "D : some sort of minimal wage .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "B : Well , we <disfmarker> we need to <disfmarker> We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan ,",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "B : cuz right now we have almost no money .",

                "D : OK .",
                "B : So <disfmarker> so the cheaper we can do it , the better .",
                "C : Well , <disfmarker>",
                "D : OK . Well , you also want to get quality .",
                "D : I mean , someone 's going to have to pass through <disfmarker> Either a higher level person will have to pass through , or you have to be sure you get good quality to begin with .",
                "C : Yeah , absolutely .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "B : Right .",
                "D : But um , yeah , that 's quite <disfmarker> you know <disfmarker> we 've <disfmarker> That 's been done .",
                "D : I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "D : She 's really <disfmarker> She 's done <disfmarker> Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : What 's her name ?",
                "D : Uh uh Doctor Susan Ervin - Tripp .",
                "C : OK .",
                "D : faculty member in Psychology , recently retired ,",
                "C : Uh - huh .",
                "C : So <disfmarker>",
                "D : and very well known in discourse analysis .",
                "C : Oh , OK .",
                "C : So , the p I mean , what I 'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of <disfmarker> I mean , it 's not a <disfmarker> it 's not an unfamiliar problem .",
                "C : So that <disfmarker>",
                "D : Oh , it 's very common .",
                "C : So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt <disfmarker> adopt them",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost ,",
                "C : I mean there 's <disfmarker> We 're <disfmarker> we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost",
                "C : cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established .",
                "C : And so that 's just whatever it is .",
                "B : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : That 's how we 'll do it .",
                "C : See what I mean ?",
                "D : I think there 's always this question of the trade - off between uh paying more for the first pass , and then h and then editing less later .",

                "C : Uh - huh .",
                "D : or paying less the first pass and editing more later .",
                "D : So",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Well , whatever they <disfmarker> people who have had to do this <disfmarker>",
                "C : I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um <disfmarker> I mean there 's <disfmarker> than <disfmarker> than what 's been done in the past",
                "C : than discourse analyzers",
                "C : because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align you know , how much time <pause> aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people .",
                "D : Oh , But that 's a s",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : OK .",
                "C : I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail .",
                "C : I think we just have basically one text file which runs from beginning to end .",
                "C : But .",
                "B : Well , if <disfmarker> in terms of transcripts , sure ,",
                "B : but in terms of speaker change it might be nice to get the actual time .",
                "C : Sure .",
                "C : But not if it costs more .",
                "B : Right .",
                "A : Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns",
                "A : and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , \" this is where this speaker change came in \"",
                "A : and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about <disfmarker>",
                "A : I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk ,",
                "C : Mm - hmm .",
                "A : is that <disfmarker> is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation .",

                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Right , I mean , the <disfmarker> it 's sort of it 's <disfmarker> a little <disfmarker> In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it <disfmarker> with Switchboard",
                "C : because the telephone is so <disfmarker> actually people are less flexible in what they do .",
                "C : In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap",
                "C : and there 's just that it 's not a very good model .",

                "C : Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance",

                "C : Right , but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what <disfmarker>",
                "C : and the variance was one take uh on it .",
                "D : Yeah ,",
                "D : I used this too .",
                "C : Right .",

                "C : Suppose you didn't have anything like that .",

                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one .",
                "C : So just having the three output thing doesn't <disfmarker> doesn't really buy you anything .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : The issue is what you feed it .",

                "D : I have <disfmarker>",
                "D : yeah .",
                "C : So uh",
                "E : So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate <disfmarker>",
                "D : No <disfmarker>",
                "C : w W well that 's another way .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : That wasn't what I was saying",
                "C : but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do .",
                "C : No I was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?",
                "E : Mmm .",
                "C : And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different .",
                "C : And something different in some fundamental way .",
                "C : And so the kind of thing that <disfmarker> that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um <disfmarker> something uh about the difference between the <disfmarker> the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : And so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch",
                "C : and she 's saying",
                "C : you know trying <disfmarker>",
                "C : So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference ,",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : but that might not be the right number .",
                "D : Maybe .",
                "C : Right ?",
                "C : I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's <disfmarker> that 's not enough",
                "C : or maybe there 's something else that <disfmarker> that one could use ,",
                "C : but I think that , for me , the thing that <disfmarker> that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here ,",
                "C : so here 's <disfmarker> here 's an idea .",
                "C : uh What about it you skip all the <disfmarker> all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?",
                "D : Ah <disfmarker> I 'm sorry .",
                "C : This is f",
                "C : You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and <disfmarker> and c c computing the variance .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : That 's a clever thing to do .",
                "C : What if you stopped being clever ?",
                "D : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful",
                "C : and figure out what they can <disfmarker> what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at .",
                "D : Yeah .",
                "C : So I mean you 're <disfmarker> you 're <disfmarker> you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should <disfmarker> we should get about this difference",
                "C : but uh in fact , you know maybe just feeding this in or <disfmarker> or feeding both of them in",
                "E : Hmm .",

                "C : But I think for <disfmarker> for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um I think that ICSLP and Eurospeech are much more targeted .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : Uh .",
                "C : And then there 's these other meetings , like HLT and <disfmarker> and uh ASRU <disfmarker>",
                "C : so there 's <disfmarker> there 's actually plenty of meetings that are really relevant to <disfmarker> to uh computational uh speech processing of one sort or another .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : Um . So .",
                "C : I mean , I mostly just ignored it because I was too busy and <vocalsound> didn't get to it .",
                "C : So uh",
                "C : Wanna talk a little bit about what we were talking about this morning ?",
                "A : Oh !",
                "C : Just briefly , or <pause> Or anything else ?",
                "A : um <pause> uh <pause> Yeah .",
                "A : So . I <disfmarker> I guess some of the progress , I <disfmarker> I 've been getting a <disfmarker> getting my committee members for the quals .",
                "A : And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek , <vocalsound> Mike Jordan ,",
                "A : and I asked John Ohala and he agreed .",
                "E : Cool .",
                "A : Yeah . Yeah .",
                "A : So I 'm <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I just need to ask um Malek .",
                "A : One more .",
                "A : Um . Tsk .",
                "A : Then uh I talked a little bit about <vocalsound> um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events ,",
                "A : and um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we 're <disfmarker> we 're <disfmarker> we 're <vocalsound> thinking about a way to test the completeness of a <disfmarker> a set of um dynamic uh events .",
                "A : Uh , completeness in the <disfmarker> in the sense that <vocalsound> um if we <disfmarker> if we pick these X number of acoustic events , <vocalsound> do they provide sufficient coverage <vocalsound> for the phones that we 're trying to recognize <vocalsound> or <disfmarker> or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .",
                "A : And so Morgan and I were uh discussing <vocalsound> um s uh s a form of a cheating experiment <vocalsound> where we get <disfmarker> <vocalsound> um we have uh <vocalsound> um a chosen set of features , or acoustic events ,",
                "A : and we train up a hybrid <vocalsound> um system to do phone recognition on TIMIT .",
                "A : So i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , <vocalsound> using um these set of acoustic events , <vocalsound> then <vocalsound> um that <disfmarker> that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover <vocalsound> a set of phones ,",
                "A : at least found in TIMIT .",
                "A : Um so i it would be a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a measure of \" are we on the right track with <disfmarker> with the <disfmarker> the choices of our acoustic events \" .",
                "A : Um , <vocalsound> So that 's going on .",
                "A : And <vocalsound> also , just uh working on my <vocalsound> uh final project for Jordan 's class ,",
                "A : uh which is <disfmarker>",
                "C : Actually , let me <disfmarker>",
                "C : Hold that thought .",
                "A : Yeah .",
                "C : Let me back up while we 're still on it .",
                "A : OK , sure .",
                "C : The <disfmarker> the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count",
                "C : and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM",
                "C : cuz that 'd be pretty simple",
                "C : because it 's just <disfmarker> Say , if you had ten <disfmarker> ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits ,",
                "C : and uh so you could make a table that would <disfmarker> say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine ,",
                "C : and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the <disfmarker> the uh <disfmarker> uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone ,",
                "C : and that would give you the likelihood of the <disfmarker> of the event given the phone .",
                "C : And um then just use that in a very simple HMM",
                "C : and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or <disfmarker>",
                "C : I mean , it 'd be on the simple side ,",
                "C : but",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : uh um",
                "C : you know , if <disfmarker> uh uh the example I was giving was that if <disfmarker> if you had um onset of voicing and <disfmarker> and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : So .",
                "C : um <disfmarker> But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong .",
                "C : I mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that .",
                "C : So um <vocalsound> uh",
                "C : If you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to <disfmarker> to do the kind of level of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> of uh classification of phones that you 'd like .",
                "C : So that was <disfmarker> that was the idea .",
                "C : And then the other thing that we were discussing was <disfmarker> was um <vocalsound> OK , how do you get the <disfmarker> your training data .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : Cuz uh the <vocalsound> Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years ,",
                "C : and",
                "C : uh similar <disfmarker> <vocalsound> similar amount of data <vocalsound> to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training .",
                "C : So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want .",
                "C : And uh <vocalsound> it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings ,",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : but <disfmarker> but",
                "C : uh it 's uh <disfmarker>",
                "E : It 's probably a good place to start .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah and a short <disfmarker> short amount of time ,",
                "C : just to <disfmarker> again , just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phones .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "E : Hmm .",
                "C : So .",
                "E : Yeah , you could even then <disfmarker> to <disfmarker> to get an idea about how different it is , you could maybe take some subset and you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand",
                "E : and then see how different it is from you know , the canonical ones ,",
                "C : Right .",
                "E : just to get an idea <disfmarker> a rough idea of h if it really even makes a difference .",
                "C : You can get a little feeling for it that way ,",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "C : yeah that is probably right .",
                "C : I mean uh my <disfmarker> my guess would be that this is <disfmarker> since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal ,",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more <disfmarker> more of one .",
                "E : Right .",
                "E : Right .",
                "C : And the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , well what if you took two events or four events or ten events or t",
                "C : and you know , and <disfmarker>",
                "C : and hopefully there should be some point at which <vocalsound> having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "E : You could define other events as being sequences of these events too .",
                "C : Uh , you could ,",
                "C : but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh <disfmarker> a translation to a per - frame feature vector ,",
                "C : so there 's no sequence in that ,",
                "C : I think .",
                "C : I think it 's just a <disfmarker>",
                "E : Unless you did like a second pass over it or something after you 've got your <disfmarker>",

                "A : and uh um basically just another method for doing classification .",
                "A : And so I 'm gonna apply that to <vocalsound> um compare it with the results by um King and Taylor who did <vocalsound> um these",

                "A : Um . So , support vector machines are <disfmarker> are good with dealing with a less amount of data",
                "E : Hmm .",
                "A : and um so if you <disfmarker> if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job <vocalsound> in learning the <disfmarker> the patterns .",

                "E : Does there some kind of a distance metric that they use",

                "A : what it <disfmarker> i at the end of the day , what it actually does is <vocalsound> it picks <vocalsound> those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary ,",

                "E : Mm - hmm .",

                "C : Uh - huh .",

                "E : and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis .",
                "E : We basically <disfmarker> it looks to me like we do the FFT , um and then we just take all the bins",
                "E : and we use everything .",
                "E : We don't have any set of parameters where we can say you know , \" only process from you know a hundred and ten hertz to thirty - seven - fifty \" .",
                "C : Um <disfmarker>",
                "E : At least I couldn't see any kind of control for that .",
                "C : Yeah , I don't think it 's in there ,",
                "C : I think it 's in the uh uh uh the filters .",
                "C : So , the F F T is on everything ,",
                "C : but the filters",
                "C : um ,",
                "C : for instance , ignore the <disfmarker> the lowest bins and the highest bins .",
                "C : And what it does is it <disfmarker> it copies",
                "E : The <disfmarker> the filters ?",

                "E : Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the RASTA libs <comment> and thing like that .",

                "C : Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all .",

                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : But it calls RASTA with some options ,",
                "C : and um",
                "E : Right .",
                "C : But I <disfmarker> I think in <disfmarker>",
                "C : I don't know .",
                "C : I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better ,",
                "C : but I think that <vocalsound> in general it 's not that critical .",
                "C : I mean there 's <disfmarker>",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "C : You can <disfmarker> You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so",
                "C : and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification at all .",
                "E : Another thing I was thinking about was um is there a <disfmarker>",

                "E : So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code",
                "E : but produce mel cepstrum",
                "E : and compare that directly to <disfmarker>",

                "C : I mean ,",
                "C : um , <vocalsound> um",
                "C : what you can do is um you can definitely change the <disfmarker> the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a triangular one ,",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : which is what the typical mel <disfmarker> mel cepstral uh filter bank does .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that ,",
                "C : so you certainly could do that easily .",
                "C : But the fundamental difference ,",
                "C : I mean , there 's other small differences <disfmarker>",
                "E : There 's a cubic root that happens ,",
                "E : right ?",
                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : but , you know , as opposed to the log in the other case .",
                "C : I mean <vocalsound> the fundamental d d difference that we 've seen any kind of difference from before , which is actually an advantage for the P L P i uh , I think , is that the <disfmarker> the smoothing at the end is auto - regressive instead of being cepstral <disfmarker> uh , <comment> from cepstral truncation .",
                "C : So um it 's a little more noise robust .",
                "E : Hmm .",
                "C : Um , and that 's <disfmarker> that 's why when people started getting databases that had a little more noise in it , like <disfmarker> like uh um Broadcast News and so on ,",
                "C : that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : So um",
                "C : That 's a difference that I don't <vocalsound> think we put any way to get around ,",
                "C : since it was an advantage .",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "C : um <vocalsound> uh",
                "C : but we did <disfmarker> eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that <vocalsound> um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal .",
                "C : So that is an option in RASTA .",
                "E : Hmm .",
                "C : Uh and you can certainly play with that .",
                "C : But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first .",
                "E : Yeah just <disfmarker> it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up .",
                "C : I don't know .",
                "C : Could be .",
                "E : You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a <disfmarker>",
                "E : So I started going through and looking <disfmarker>",
                "E : One of the things that I did notice was that the um log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the PLP data were much lower , much smaller ,",
                "E : than for the mel cepstral stuff , and that the average amount of pruning that was happening was therefore a little bit higher for the PLP features .",
                "C : Oh - huh !",
                "E : So , since he used the same exact pruning thresholds for both , I was wondering if it could be that we 're getting more pruning .",
                "C : Oh !",
                "C : He <disfmarker> he <disfmarker> <vocalsound> He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "C : Oh well that 's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That 's a pretty good <comment> point right there .",
                "E : Right .",
                "E : Right .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "E : Yeah ,",
                "E : so <disfmarker>",
                "C : I would think that you might wanna do something like uh you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors .",
                "E : That 's <disfmarker>",
                "E : Right .",
                "E : Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through ,",
                "E : then run them through again",
                "E : but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "E : So .",
                "C : But I mean you could <disfmarker> uh if <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> if that looks promising you could , you know , r uh run <vocalsound> the overall test set with a <disfmarker> with a few different uh pruning thresholds for both ,",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "E : Right .",
                "C : and presumably he 's running at some pruning threshold that 's <disfmarker> that 's uh , you know <disfmarker> gets very few search errors",
                "C : but is <disfmarker> is relatively fast",
                "E : Mm - hmm .",
                "E : Right . I mean , yeah , generally in these things you <disfmarker> you turn back pruning really far ,",
                "C : and <disfmarker>",
                "E : so I <disfmarker> I didn't think it would be that big a deal",
                "E : because I was figuring well you have it turned back so far that you know it <disfmarker>",
                "C : But you may be in the wrong range for the P L P features for some reason .",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "E : Yeah .",
                "E : And the uh the <disfmarker> the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer",
                "E : which sort of implies that the networks are bushier ,",
                "E : you know , there 's more things it 's considering",
                "E : which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .",
                "E : So uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning too much .",
                "E : So .",
                "C : Yeah .",
                "C : Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions",
                "C : and <disfmarker> and",

                "C : There 's no particular reason why they would be exactly <disfmarker> behave exactly the same .",

                "C : Yeah ,",
                "C : I mean , as helpful <disfmarker>",

                "C : Uh , you know , if you 're doing a uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a sixteen digit uh credit card number you 'll basically get it wrong almost all the time .",
