Did you have a time in mind? <USER> How about 7 o'clock this evening? <SYSTEM> It looks like the movie is showing on both standard and IMAX theaters. Do you have a preference? <USER> IMAX would be cool. <SYSTEM> Great. And you said you wanted two tickets, right? <USER> Yep. <SYSTEM> The AMC Cinema at the Universal CityWalk is playing Us in IMAX, but the next showing time is at 8 PM. Is that ok? <USER> Hm, I'd rather go earlier. What about the ArcLight theater in Sherman Oaks? <SYSTEM> The ArcLight is showing the movie at 7:15 PM, but it's on a standard screen, not IMAX. Is that ok? <USER> Yeah, that will be fine, I guess. How much is it for two tickets? <SYSTEM> Tickets are $17 each, so it would be about $34 plus tax. <USER> Hm, that's a little pricey. Any other theaters? <SYSTEM> The AMC 6 in Burbank is also showing the movie at that time, and tickets are $15 each.",

Did you have a time in mind? <USER> How about 7 o'clock this evening? <SYSTEM> It looks like the movie is showing on both standard and IMAX theaters. Do you have a preference? <USER> IMAX would be cool. <SYSTEM> Great. And you said you wanted two tickets, right? <USER> Yep. <SYSTEM> The AMC Cinema at the Universal CityWalk is playing Us in IMAX, but the next showing time is at 8 PM. Is that ok? <USER> Hm, I'd rather go earlier. What about the ArcLight theater in Sherman Oaks? <SYSTEM> The ArcLight is showing the movie at 7:15 PM, but it's on a standard screen, not IMAX. Is that ok? <USER> Yeah, that will be fine, I guess. How much is it for two tickets? <SYSTEM> Tickets are $17 each, so it would be about $34 plus tax. <USER> Hm, that's a little pricey. Any other theaters? <SYSTEM> The AMC 6 in Burbank is also showing the movie at that time, and tickets are $15 each. <USER> I guess the price isn't much different. Let's go with the ArcLight at 7:15 pm. <SYSTEM> OK, to confirm: two tickets to see Us at the ArcLight Theater in Sherman Oaks at 7:15 pm. The price will be $34 plus tax.",
